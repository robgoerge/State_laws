Upon presentation of the certificate to any judge having jurisdiction over the person confined, and upon notice to the attorney general, the judge in this state shall fix a time and place for a hearing and shall make an order directed to the person having custody of the prisoner requiring that the prisoner be produced before the judge at the hearing.

976.03(3)
(3)â€‚Form of demand.  No demand for the extradition of a person charged with a crime in another state shall be recognized by the governor unless in writing alleging, except in cases arising under sub.

The indictment, information or affidavit made before the magistrate must substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime under the law of that state; and the copy of indictment, information, affidavit, judgment of conviction or sentence must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand.
976.03(4)
(4)â€‚Governor may investigate case.  When a demand shall be made upon the governor of this state by the executive authority of another state for the surrender of a person so charged with a crime, the governor may call upon the attorney general or any prosecuting officer in this state to investigate or assist in investigating the demand, and to report to the governor the situation and circumstances of the person so demanded, and whether the person ought to be surrendered.
976.03(5)
(5)â€‚Extradition of persons imprisoned or awaiting trial in another state or who have left the demanding state under compulsion. 976.03(5)(a)(a)  When it is desired to have returned to this state a person charged in this state with a crime, and such person is imprisoned or is held under criminal proceedings then pending against the person in another state, the governor of this state may agree with the executive authority of such other state for the extradition of such person before the conclusion of such proceedings or the person's term of sentence in such other state, upon condition that such person be returned to such other state at the expense of this state as soon as the prosecution in this state is terminated.
976.03(5)(b)
(b)  The governor of this state may also surrender on demand of the executive authority of any other state any person in this state who is charged in the manner provided in sub. (23) with having violated the laws of the state whose executive authority is making the demand, even though such person left the demanding state involuntarily.
976.03(6)
(6)â€‚Extradition of persons charged with having committed a crime in the demanding state by acts done in this or some other state.

(3) with committing an act in this state, or in a third state, intentionally resulting in a crime in the state whose executive authority is making the demand; and the provisions of this section not otherwise inconsistent shall apply to such cases, notwithstanding that the accused was not in that state at the time of the commission of the crime, and has not fled therefrom.
976.03(7)
(7)â€‚Issue of governor's warrant of arrest; its recitals.  If the governor shall decide that the demand should be complied with, the governor shall sign a warrant of arrest, which shall be sealed with the state seal, and be directed to a sheriff, marshal, coroner or other person whom the governor may think fit to entrust with the execution thereof; and the warrant must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issue.
976.03(8)

The warrant shall authorize the officer or other person to whom directed to arrest the accused at any place where the accused may be found within the state and to command the aid of all sheriffs and other peace officers in the execution of the warrant, and to deliver the accused subject to this section, to the duly authorized agent of the demanding state.
976.03(9)
(9)â€‚Authority of arresting officer.  Every such officer or other person empowered to make the arrest shall have the same authority in arresting the accused to command assistance therein, as sheriffs and other officers have by law in the execution of any criminal process directed to them, with the like penalties against those who refuse their assistance.
976.03(10)
(10)â€‚Rights of accused; application for habeas corpus.  No person arrested upon such warrant may be delivered over to the agent whom the executive authority demanding the person shall have appointed to receive the person unless the person shall first be taken forthwith before a judge of a court of record in this state, who shall inform the person of the demand made for the person's surrender and of the crime with which the person is charged, and that the person has the right to demand and procure legal counsel; and if the prisoner or the prisoner's counsel shall state that the prisoner desires to test the legality of the prisoner's arrest, the judge of such court of record shall fix a reasonable time to be allowed the prisoner within which to commence an action for habeas corpus.  When such action is commenced, notice thereof, and of the time and place of hearing thereon, shall be given to the prosecuting officer of the county in which the arrest is made and in which the accused is in custody, and to the said agent of the demanding state.
