155.10 History
History:  1989 a. 200; 1991 a. 281; 2009 a. 28.155.10 Annotation
Wisconsin statutes provide 3 instruments through which an individual may state healthcare wishes in the event of incapacitation: a "declaration to physicians," a "do-not-resuscitate order," and a "health care power of attorney."  These statutory instruments apply under specific circumstances, have their own signature requirements, and may be limited in the extent of authorization they afford.  A form will trigger no statutory immunities for healthcare providers when it lacks the features of these statutory documents.  A court might conclude, however, that such a form is relevant in discerning a person's intent.  OAG 10-14155.20
