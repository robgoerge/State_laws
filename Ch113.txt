Section 893.19 (3) [now 893.43] applies to an action for contribution against a joint tort-feasor arising out of the settlement of a tort claim.  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Schara, 56 Wis. 2d 262, 201 N.W.2d 758 (1972).113.03

The amount or value of any consideration received by the obligee from one or more of several obligors, or from one or more of joint, or of joint and several obligors, in whole or in partial satisfaction of their obligations, shall be credited to the extent of the amount received on the obligations of all co-obligors to whom the obligor or obligors giving the consideration did not stand in the relation of a surety.

Release of some, effect.  Subject to s. 113.03, the obligee's release or discharge of one or more of several obligors, or of one or more of joint, or of joint and several obligors shall not discharge co-obligors, against whom the obligee in writing and as part of the same transaction as the release or discharge, expressly reserves the obligee's rights; and in the absence of such reservation of such rights shall discharge co-obligors only to the extent provided in s. 113.05.
113.04 History
History:  1993 a. 492.113.04 Annotation
Release of one tort-feasor, reserving all rights against another, limits recovery against the other to the percentage of that other's negligence.  Peiffer v. Allstate Insurance Co. 51 Wis. 2d 329, 187 N.W.2d 182 (1971).113.04 Annotation
There is a rebuttable presumption that a general release of the original tort-feasor does not release a malpractice cause of action for damages that might be recovered against the original tort-feasor unless clearly and expressly stated in the release.  Rights need not be reserved against the doctor.  Krenz v. Medical Protective Co. 57 Wis. 2d 387, 204 N.W.2d 663 (1973); Westphal v. Cantwell-Peterson Clinic, 57 Wis. 2d 402, 204 N.W.2d 491 (1973).113.05

(1)â€‚If an obligee releasing or discharging an obligor without express reservation of rights against a co-obligor, then knows or has reason to know that the obligor released or discharged did not pay so much of the claim as the obligor was bound by contract or relation with that co-obligor to pay, the obligee's claim against that co-obligor shall be satisfied to the amount which the obligee knew or had reason to know that the released or discharged obligor was bound to such co-obligor to pay.
113.05(2)
(2)â€‚If an obligee so releasing or discharging an obligor has not then such knowledge or reason to know, the obligee's claim against the co-obligor shall be satisfied to the extent of the lesser of the amount of the fractional share of the obligor released or discharged, or the amount that such obligor was bound by contract or relation with the co-obligor to pay.
