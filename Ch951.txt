Rather than exclude all non-captive wild animals from coverage of ch. 951, the legislature instead prohibits enforcement that controverts ch. 29 and regulations governing "the taking of wild animals."  By prohibiting a subset of takings â€” those that controvert ch. 29 â€” the legislature necessarily conveys its belief that there are takings that do not controvert ch. 29.  State v.
