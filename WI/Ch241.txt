No assignment of the salary or wages of any person is valid as to any such salary or wages accruing more than 6 months after the date of the making of the assignment, except that any assignment of wages made in connection with a proceeding under s. 128.21 shall run concurrently with the period during which the amortization proceedings are in effect and shall become void upon the dismissal of the proceedings.

241.24â€ƒ
Board of trade contracts.  No contract for the future purchase, sale, transfer or delivery of personal property through a board of trade or organized commodity exchange is void when either party thereto intends, in good faith, to perform the same; and an intention on the part of either not to perform any such contract does not invalidate it if the other party in good faith intends to perform the same.  No such contract is void because the vendor was not, at the time it was made, the owner of the property contracted to be sold; and in any action by either party for the enforcement of its terms or to recover damages for a breach thereof it is incompetent to show in defense, by any extrinsic evidence, that such contract had any other intent or meaning than it expresses; and it and all collateral contracts, agreements or securities growing out of it or of which they may have formed the consideration in whole or in part are legal and valid.  Nothing herein shall be construed to exclude evidence of fraud in the procuring of any such contract as is first mentioned herein, or of any collateral contract, agreement or security growing out of it, or that any such contract was not entered into upon sufficient consideration, or is not supported thereby, or that both parties intended to make a wagering contract.

Contracts requiring warning.  Every proposed contract for the benefit of any person, firm or corporation furnishing or supplying in any wise whatever, goods, wares or merchandise to hawkers or peddlers and which by its terms upon execution thereof would bind any person to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of any such hawker or peddler, in lawfully or unlawfully disposing of such goods, wares or merchandise or the proceeds thereof, or which would bind any person to guarantee or answer for any debt or liability incurred by such hawker or peddler in acquiring any title to or interest in the goods, wares or merchandise to be disposed of by such hawker or peddler or in acquiring any title to or interest in any equipment intended to be used in conducting the business of such hawker or peddler, shall have plainly printed upon it, in red ink, in type not smaller than 10 point boldface type, at the time of its execution and directly above the place for the signature of the person who would, by signing such contract, become obligated to so answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of any such peddler or hawker, the following statement:  "Warning â€” this may obligate you to pay money".  Every such contract not containing such statement shall be unlawful and in any action brought upon any such contract in any court of this state, such contract shall be construed in accordance with the laws of this state.  The provisions of this section, however, shall not apply to any such contract where the same contains a provision expressly limiting the amount of the liability of each person obligated to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of any such peddler or hawker.
