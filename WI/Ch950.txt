950.01â€ƒ
Legislative intent.  In recognition of the civic and moral duty of victims and witnesses of crime to fully and voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies, and in further recognition of the continuing importance of such citizen cooperation to state and local law enforcement efforts and the general effectiveness and well-being of the criminal justice system of this state, the legislature declares its intent, in this chapter, to ensure that all victims and witnesses of crime are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy and sensitivity; and that the rights extended in this chapter to victims and witnesses of crime are honored and protected by law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and judges in a manner no less vigorous than the protections afforded criminal defendants.  This chapter does not prohibit a public official, employee, or agency from sharing information with victim service organizations that are eligible to receive grants under s. 49.165 (2) or 165.93 (2).  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.
950.01 History
History:  1979 c. 219; 2011 a. 283; 2013 a. 323.950.01 Annotation
The state did not breach a plea agreement when two police officers, one of whom the defendant shot during the execution of a search warrant, requested during the sentencing hearing that the sentencing court impose the maximum sentence.  The police officers were not speaking to the court as investigating officers, but as victims of a crime.  In Wisconsin, every crime victim has the right to make a statement to the court at the disposition.  State v. Stewart, 2013 WI App 86, 349 Wis. 2d 385, 836 N.W.2d 456, 12-1457.950.02
