History:  1975 c. 39, 199; 1977 c. 187 ss. 92, 135; 1977 c. 449; Stats. 1977 s. 753.016; 1979 c. 110 s. 60 (13); 1981 c. 96, 353; 1985 a. 176; 1995 a. 201.753.03

Jurisdiction of circuit courts.  The circuit courts have the general jurisdiction prescribed for them by article VII of the constitution and have power to issue all writs, process and commissions provided in article VII of the constitution or by the statutes, or which may be necessary to the due execution of the powers vested in them.  The circuit courts have power to hear and determine, within their respective circuits, all civil and criminal actions and proceedings unless exclusive jurisdiction is given to some other court; and they have all the powers, according to the usages of courts of law and equity, necessary to the full and complete jurisdiction of the causes and parties and the full and complete administration of justice, and to carry into effect their judgments, orders and other determinations, subject to review by the court of appeals or the supreme court as provided by law.  The courts and the judges thereof have power to award all such writs, process and commissions, throughout the state, returnable in the proper county.
753.03 History
History:  1977 c. 187 s. 92; Stats. 1977 s. 753.03; 1983 a. 192.753.03 Annotation
The circuit courts are constitutional courts with plenary jurisdiction.  They do not depend solely upon statute for their powers.  However in certain cases with vast social ramifications not addressed by statute, prudence requires the courts to refuse to exercise their jurisdiction.  As such, circuit courts are prohibited from exercising jurisdiction regarding sterilization of incompetents.  In Matter of Guardianship of Eberhardy, 102 Wis. 2d 539, 307 N.W.2d 881 (1981).753.03 Annotation
Because courts have exclusive criminal jurisdiction, criminal charges against a defendant were not collaterally estopped even though a parole revocation hearing examiner concluded that the defendant's acts did not merit parole revocation.  State v. Spanbauer, 108 Wis. 2d 548, 322 N.W.2d 511 (Ct. App. 1982).753.04
753.04â€ƒ
Writs, how issued; certiorari.  All writs issued from the circuit court shall be in the name of the state of Wisconsin, shall bear date the day they are issued, be attested in the name of the judge of the circuit in which issued, and if there is no such judge, then in the name of the chief judge of the court of appeals or the chief justice of the supreme court, be returnable on a date certain which is not more than 60 days from the date of issuance, unless otherwise directed by law, by the judge or by rule of court, be signed by the clerk, sealed with the seal of the court and directed to some officer or person authorized to serve or execute the writs.  All writs of certiorari issued to review any action taken by a county board, town board, common council of any city or board of trustees of any village, or any record lawfully in the custody of a county clerk, town clerk, city clerk or village clerk may be addressed to and served upon the proper county clerk, town clerk, city clerk or village clerk, respectively, who shall make return thereto.
753.04 History
History:  1977 c. 187 s. 92; 1977 c. 449; Stats. 1977 s. 753.04.753.04 Annotation
A certiorari action exists only to test the validity of judicial or quasi-judicial determinations.  It does not allow for answers, denials, or defenses by the respondent.  Merkel v. Village of Germantown, 218 Wis. 2d 572, 581 N.W.2d 552 (Ct. App. 1998), 97-3347.753.05
753.05â€ƒ
Seals.  The circuit courts in the several counties shall have seals, and they may direct and from time to time alter the inscriptions and devices thereon; and the respective county boards shall furnish such seals as shall be ordered; and when any such court shall be unprovided with a seal the judge may authorize the use of any temporary seal or of any device by way of seal until a seal shall be so provided.  The seals now in use by said courts shall continue to be the seals thereof until others shall be provided according to law.
