812.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 759 (1975); Stats. 1975 s. 812.01; 1981 c. 79 s. 17; 1985 a. 37; 1993 a. 80, 486.812.01 Annotation
The doctrine of marshaling assets is discussed.  Moser Paper Co. v. North Shore Pub. Co. 83 Wis. 2d 852, 266 N.W.2d 411 (1978).812.01 Annotation
To be subject to garnishment, a debt must be owing absolutely at the time of the service of process, even if payable later.  When the question of indebtedness depends entirely upon future contingencies, there is no liability.  Hometown Bank v. Acuity Insurance, 2008 WI App 48, 308 Wis. 2d 503, 748 N.W.2d 203, 07-1048.812.01 Annotation
Notwithstanding sub. (2), procedures in ch. 799 are used in small claims garnishment actions.  Wisconsin Natural Gas Co. v. Kletsch, 95 Wis. 2d 691, 291 N.W.2d 640 (Ct. App. 1980).
812.01 Annotation
An otherwise valid judgment can be enforced against a legal entity when the judgment is entered against the name under which the legal entity does business.  If the name under which a person or corporation does business is "simply another way to refer to" a single legal entity and constitutes no entity distinct from the person or corporation who does business, then a judgment against the "doing business as" name is enforceable against the legal entity from which it is indistinct.  Paul Davis Restoration of S.E. Wisconsin, Inc. v. Paul Davis Restoration of Northeast Wisconsin, 2013 WI 49, 347 Wis. 2d 614, 831 N.W.2d 413, 11-1121.812.01 Annotation
A Wisconsin court may issue an in personam order affecting out-of-state property, even though the court does not have in rem jurisdiction over the property.  A debt may generally be garnished wherever personal jurisdiction may be exercised over the garnishee.  Midland Funding, LLC v. Mizinski, 2014 WI App 82, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ N.W.2d ___, 13-2422.812.01 Annotation
A plaintiff in a garnishment action has no right to receive any property from the garnishee until superior liens are satisfied.  The mere fact that a creditor was the first party to file a garnishment action is not dispositive of priority.  Prince Corporation v. Vandenberg, 2015 WI App 55, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ N.W.2d ___, 14-2097.812.01 Annotation
The state is immune from suit in any garnishment action not involving a state employee or officer.  77 Atty. Gen. 17.812.01 Annotation
