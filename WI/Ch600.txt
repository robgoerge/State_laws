This publication does not guarantee or promise that your medical bills will be published or assigned to others for payment.  Whether anyone chooses to pay your medical bills is entirely voluntary.  This publication should never be considered a substitute for an insurance policy.  Whether or not you receive any payments for medical expenses, and whether or not this publication continues to operate, you are responsible for the payment of your own medical bills.

Cross-reference:  See also Ins and chs. Ins 15 and 22, Wis. adm. code.600.01 Annotation
Legislative Council Note to (1) (a), 1975: There is a widespread but entirely erroneous notion that the provisions of the insurance code constitute, in general, an enabling act.  On the contrary, insurance is an area of free contractual activity except as restricted by the insurance code.  It is well to have that point of departure clearly established by the statutes.  [Bill 642-S]
600.01 Annotation
Excess-of-policy coverage clause in a reinsurance agreement constituted a liability insurance contract insuring against tortious failure to settle a claim and was not exempt from regulation under sub. (1) (b) 1.  Ott v. All-Star Ins. Corp. 99 Wis. 2d 635, 299 N.W.2d 839 (1981).600.02
