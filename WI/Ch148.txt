The transfer of all the assets and liabilities of the State Medical Society's Wisconsin Physicians Service was precluded by the Society's statutory duty of exclusive control, since the transfer would result in separation of the Society's assets from those of the new corporation and permit use of Physicians Service assets and structure for purposes not consistent with the legislative intent of ch. 148.
