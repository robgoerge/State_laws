801.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 588 (1975); 1977 c. 449; 1979 c. 89; 1981 c. 390.801.01 Annotation
Chapters 801 to 847 apply to in rem actions under s. 161.555 [now 961.555] and under s. 801.07 may not be brought against an inanimate object as sole "defendant."  State v. One 1973 Cadillac, 95 Wis. 2d 641, 291 N.W.2d 626 (Ct. App. 1980).801.01 Annotation

The applicability of chs. 801 to 847 in civil actions is not determined by a "mere alleged incompatibility" of statutes.  Without an explicit or implicit prescription by the statute of a "different procedure," chs. 801 to 847 are applicable in civil proceedings.  State v. Brown, 215 Wis. 2d 716, 573 N.W.2d 884 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-1211.801.01 Annotation
