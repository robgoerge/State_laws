9.01(1)(ag)2.
2.  If subd. 1 does not apply to the difference between the votes cast for the leading candidate and those cast for the petitioner or the difference between the affirmative and negative votes cast upon any referendum question following canvassing of all valid provisional and absentee ballots, the petitioner shall pay a fee equal to the actual cost of performing the recount in each ward for which the petition requests a recount, or in each municipality for which the petition requests a recount where no wards exist.

(b)  The proper board of canvassers shall reconvene no earlier than 9 a.m. on the day following delivery of notice to all candidates under sub.

The board of canvassers shall then proceed to recount the ballots in the wards or municipalities specified and to review the allegations of fact contained in the petition or petitions.  The recount shall proceed for each ward or municipality as follows:
9.01(1)(b)1.
1.  The board of canvassers shall first compare the poll lists and determine the number of voting electors.
9.01(1)(b)2.
2.  The board of canvassers shall then examine the absentee ballot envelopes.  Any defective absentee ballot envelopes shall be laid aside, properly marked and carefully preserved.  The number of voters shall be reduced by the number of ballot envelopes set aside under this subdivision.  An absentee ballot envelope is defective only if it is not witnessed or if it is not signed by the voter or if the certificate accompanying an absentee ballot that the voter received by facsimile transmission or electronic mail is missing.
9.01(1)(b)3.
3.  The board of canvassers shall then examine the container or bag containing the ballots to be certain it has not been tampered with, opened, or opened and resealed.  Any irregularities or possible tampering with the container or bag shall be noted.
9.01(1)(b)4.
4. 9.01(1)(b)4.a.a.  When the container or bag has been checked, it shall be opened and the contents removed.  The board of canvassers shall, without examination other than what is necessary to determine that each is a single ballot, count the number of ballots in the container or bag, excluding ballots removed under s. 7.51 (2) (e).
9.01(1)(b)4.b.
b.  The board of canvassers shall then, for each opened absentee ballot envelope that was laid aside as defective under subd. 2., without inspection, randomly draw one absentee ballot from the container or bag.  In differentiating absentee ballots from other ballots, the board of canvassers shall presume that a ballot initialed only by the municipal clerk, the executive director of the board of election commissioners, or a deputy clerk or secretary is an absentee ballot.  If there are more defective absentee ballot envelopes than there are probable absentee ballots, all of the probable absentee ballots shall be removed from the container or bag.  Additional ballots shall be removed only if the number of remaining ballots still exceeds the number of voting electors recorded under subd. 1., reduced by the number of defective envelopes set aside under subd. 2.  All ballots removed shall not be counted, but shall be marked as to the reason for their removal, set aside and carefully preserved.
9.01(1)(b)4.c.
c.  If, after completing the steps set forth in subd. 4. b., the number of ballots still exceeds the number of voters, the board of canvassers shall place all ballots face up to check for blank ballots.  Any blank ballots shall be so marked, set aside and carefully preserved.
9.01(1)(b)4.d.
d.  If, after completing the steps set forth in subd. 4. c., the number of ballots still exceeds the number of voters reduced by the number of defective envelopes set aside under subd. 2., the board of canvassers shall place all ballots face down to check the initials.  Any ballot not properly initialed by 2 inspectors or any absentee ballot not properly initialed by the municipal clerk, the executive director of the board of election commissioners, or a deputy clerk or secretary shall be temporarily set aside and the board of canvassers shall, without inspection, randomly draw from these ballots as many as are necessary to reduce the number of ballots to equal the number of voters.  Any ballots removed for lack of initials shall not be counted but shall be marked, set aside and carefully preserved.
9.01(1)(b)4.e.
e.  If, after completing the steps set forth in subd. 4. d., the number of ballots still exceeds the number of voters reduced by the number of defective envelopes set aside under subd. 2., the remaining ballots shall be returned to the container or bag and the board of canvassers shall draw a number of ballots equal to the excess number of ballots by chance and without inspection from the container or bag.  These ballots shall not be counted but shall be marked as having been removed by the canvassers on recount due to an excess number of ballots, set aside and carefully preserved.
9.01(1)(b)5.
5.  When the number of ballots and voters agree, or after noting that the number of voters exceeds the number of ballots, the board of canvassers shall return all ballots to be counted to the ballot box and shall turn the ballot box in such manner as to thoroughly mix the ballots.  The recount shall then begin.
9.01(1)(b)5m.
5m.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the recount shall be conducted in accordance with s. 7.51.
9.01(1)(b)6.
6.  In recounting the votes cast on a voting machine in which the record of the votes cast is contained in the machine, the board of canvassers shall make a record of the number of the seal, if any, the number of the protective counter or other device, if one is provided, and shall open the recording compartment of the machine, and without unlocking the machine against voting, shall recount the votes thereon.  If the machine is an electronic voting machine utilizing a detachable record of votes cast, the record shall be retabulated under s. 5.90.
9.01(1)(b)7.
7.  When a machine is recounted, the board of canvassers shall proceed to inspect and examine the machine showing the votes cast for each office or referendum specified in the petition, and shall make a record of the votes for that office or referendum as shown on that voting machine, which they shall certify as correct, in the presence of at least one witness.
9.01(1)(b)8.
8.  If upon the recount it is found that the original canvass of the returns has been correctly made from a voting machine and that a discrepancy still remains unaccounted for, the board of canvassers shall publicly unlock the voting and counting mechanism of the machine, and shall proceed to examine and test the machine to determine the cause of the discrepancy in returns from the machine.  A similar test shall be performed for electronic voting machines to ascertain whether there is any malfunction in the machine.  After the completion of the examination and test, the board of canvassers shall prepare a statement giving the results of the examination and test.  The statement shall be witnessed by at least one witness.
9.01(1)(b)8m.
8m.  Where a voting machine or electronic voting system is used, and an error in the vote total as shown on the machine or record of votes cast is clearly apparent, the board of canvassers may change the vote total as shown by the machine or system and certify or use a different total to certify a different result than is indicated by the machine or system if there is evidence of a specific malfunction in the machine or system, if the malfunction could reasonably have caused the error, and if clear and convincing evidence exists which indicates the exact actual total number of votes cast.  The burden of demonstrating that a vote total shown on a machine or record of votes cast is incorrect rests with the party seeking to change the recorded result on the basis of clear and convincing evidence.
9.01(1)(b)8s.
8s.  If an electronic voting system is used in which ballots are distributed to electors, and the board of canvassers makes a determination of elector intent under s. 7.50, the board of canvassers shall add to the result generated by the automatic tabulating equipment any votes counted by the board of canvassers in making its determination.
9.01(1)(b)9.
9.  If upon the recount it appears that the original canvass of the returns by the election officials was incorrect, the statements and determinations of the board of canvassers shall be corrected accordingly.
9.01(1)(b)10.
10.  Recounts at polling places utilizing an electronic voting system in which ballots are distributed to electors shall be performed in accordance with the procedure for recounting paper ballots insofar as applicable, except as provided in s. 5.90.  Recounts at polling places utilizing electronic voting machines shall be performed in accordance with the procedure for recounting votes cast on mechanical voting machines, insofar as applicable, except as provided in s. 5.90.
