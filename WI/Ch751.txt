(1)â€‚The chief justice of the supreme court may assign any active supreme court justice, court of appeals judge or circuit judge to serve temporarily as a judge of the court of appeals or any circuit court to aid in the proper disposition of business in that court.  The chief justice of the supreme court may designate and assign reserve judges under s. 753.075 to serve temporarily in the court of appeals or the circuit court for any county.  While acting under a temporary assignment, an active or reserve justice or judge may exercise all the authority of the court to which he or she is assigned.
751.03(2)
(2)â€‚The chief justice of the supreme court may exercise the authority under sub. (1) in regard to municipal courts for the purpose of:
751.03(2)(a)
(a)  Assigning a case in which a change of judge is requested under s. 757.19 (5) or is required under s. 800.05 to another municipal judge or, if none is available, transferring the case to circuit court.
751.03(2)(b)
(b)  Assigning cases in municipal court in which a municipal judge is incompetent, unable or fails to act, to another municipal judge, former municipal judge or former circuit judge.  A judge to whom cases are so assigned may serve until the chief justice determines that the incompetency, inability or failure ceases, or until the term of the municipal judge expires or the vacancy is permanently filled under s. 8.50 (4) (fm), whichever occurs first.  If no judge is available, the chief justice may transfer a case from municipal court to circuit court.

Otherwise the judge assigned may grant a new trial or rehearing.
751.03(4)(b)
(b)  If a judge before whom an action or proceeding has been tried is unable to proceed after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, the judge to whom the case is assigned may proceed with it unless satisfied that the duties cannot be performed without prejudice to the parties, in which event a new trial may be granted.
751.03(5)

751.03 Note
Judicial Council Note, 1985: Sub. (4), modeled on proposed Rule 63, F.R.C.P., provides a procedure to be followed when the presiding judge dies, becomes disabled, or is otherwise unable to proceed, either during trial or after the verdict or findings and conclusions have been filed.  It provides an efficient mechanism for completing these cases without violating due process, preventing unnecessary expense and delay. [Re Order effective July 1, 1985]

Discretionary reversal.  In an appeal in the supreme court, if it appears from the record that the real controversy has not been fully tried, or that it is probable that justice has for any reason miscarried, the court may reverse the judgment or order appealed from, regardless of whether the proper motion or objection appears in the record, and may direct the entry of the proper judgment or remit the case to the trial court for the entry of the proper judgment or for a new trial, and direct the making of such amendments in the pleadings and the adoption of such procedure in that court, not inconsistent with statutes or rules, as are necessary to accomplish the ends of justice.
751.06 History
History:  1977 c. 187 s. 76; Stats. 1977 s. 751.06.751.06 Annotation
The court may reverse in the interest of justice even though proper motions or objections were not made.  A judgment was reversed because the defendant's counsel persisted in asking questions that amounted to testimony on his part and because in arguing to the jury he commented on facts that he had observed.  Lorenz v. Wolff, 45 Wis. 2d 407, 173 N.W.2d 129 (1970).751.06 Annotation
A general judgment creditor, having failed to timely appeal from a foreclosure judgment, was not entitled under this section to remand for a factual determination of a real, although perhaps untried, issue affecting the homestead exemption.  Anchor Savings & Loan Association v. Week, 62 Wis. 2d 169, 213 N.W.2d 737 (1974).751.06 Annotation
A new trial was necessary because of the prosecution's failure to make full and fair pretrial disclosure to the defendant of exculpatory evidence.  State v. Stanislawski, 62 Wis. 2d 730, 216 N.W.2d 8 (1974).751.06 Annotation
Requirements for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence are discussed.  State v. Boyce, 75 Wis. 2d 452, 249 N.W.2d 758 (1977).751.06 Annotation
When a verdict form did not contain a special fact question regarding a major issue of the case, the real issues had not been tried.  Schulz v. St. Mary's Hospital, 81 Wis. 2d 638, 260 N.W.2d 783 (1978).751.06 Annotation
Although failure to object at a conference under s. 805.13 to a substantive defect in the verdict constituted waiver, the failure to object did not preclude the court's consideration of the defect under s. 751.06.  Clark v. Leisure Vehicles, Inc. 96 Wis. 2d 607, 292 N.W.2d 630 (1980).  See also Air Wisconsin, Inc. v. North Central Airlines, Inc. 98 Wis. 2d 301, 296 N.W.2d 749 (1980).751.06 Annotation
When the credibility of a witness was a critical issue, exclusion under s. 906.08 (1) of the evidence offered was grounds for discretionary reversal.  State v. Cuyler, 110 Wis. 2d 133, 327 N.W.2d 662 (1983). Down
