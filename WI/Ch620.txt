620.01â€ƒ
Purpose and scope. 620.01(1)(1)â€‚
Investment objectives.  The purpose of this chapter is to protect and to further the interests of insureds, creditors and the public, by providing, with minimum interference with management initiative and judgment, standards for the development and administration of programs for the investment of the assets of insurers, which standards seek an optimal balance of the following objectives:
620.01(1)(a)
(a)  Safety of principal, and to the extent consistent therewith, maximum yield and growth;
620.01(1)(b)
(b)  Stability of value, except where higher risk and possible fluctuations of value are compensated by a commensurate increase in yield and growth possibilities, and either special reserves or surplus is available in sufficient amount to cover reasonably foreseeable fluctuations in value;
620.01(1)(c)
(c)  Sufficient liquidity to avoid the necessity in reasonably expected circumstances for selling assets at undue sacrifice;
620.01(1)(d)
(d)  Reasonable diversification with respect to geographical area, industry, maturity, types of investment, individual investments and other relevant variables; and
620.01(1)(e)
(e)  Reasonable relationship between liabilities and assets as to term and nature.
620.01(2)
(2)â€‚Scope.  Except as otherwise provided, this chapter and the rules promulgated to interpret and implement it, apply to all insurers authorized to do business in this state.

620.02(2)(b)
(b) 
Guaranteed benefits.  To the extent that the corporation's reserve liability, with regard to benefits guaranteed as to dollar amount and duration and funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated rate of interest, is maintained in any separate account, a portion of the assets of the account at least equal to the reserve liability shall be invested in accordance with this chapter, or in accordance with such requirements as the commissioner prescribes by rule.

(3)â€‚Valuation of segregated account assets.  Assets allocated to a segregated account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation, or if there is no readily available market, then in accordance with the applicable contract; but a portion of the assets of the account at least equal to the corporation's reserve liability with regard to the guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in sub. (2), if any, shall be reported separately and valued in accordance with the rules otherwise applicable to the corporation's assets or in accordance with rules promulgated under sub. (2).  No securities valuation reserve or other reserve for fluctuation in the value of securities need be maintained for assets that do not have to comply with this chapter.

620.03(2)
(2)â€‚Exemptions.  The commissioner may by order grant an insurer exemption from any restriction under sub. (1) to the extent that the commissioner is satisfied that the interests of insureds, creditors and the public of this state are sufficiently protected in other ways, such as by the investment regulation actually exercised in the domicile of a nondomestic insurer; or by other evidence of the solidity of the insurer and the competence of its management and its investment advisers.
620.03(3)
(3)â€‚Extensions.  The commissioner may by rule apply to a class of insurers any restriction of sub.

620.04(1)(a)
(a)  For insurers that are not restricted under s. 620.03, impose reasonable and temporary restrictions upon the investments of an individual insurer, including prohibition or divestment of a particular investment.

620.04(2)
(2)â€‚Consent investments.  The commissioner may count an asset toward satisfaction of the compulsory surplus requirement or the security surplus standard, or both, even if it does not conform to this chapter or rules promulgated thereunder, if the commissioner finds that counting it does not endanger the interests of insureds, creditors or the public.
620.04(3)
(3)â€‚Alien investments.  The commissioner may count toward satisfaction of the compulsory surplus requirement or the security surplus standard any assets in which an insurer must invest under the laws of a country other than the United States as a condition for doing business in that country if the commissioner finds that counting them does not endanger the interests of insureds, creditors or the public of this state.

The commissioner may by order exempt an insurer, or by rule a class of insurers, from this requirement if the obligations in other currencies are small enough that no significant problem for solidity would be created by substantial fluctuations in relative currency values.
