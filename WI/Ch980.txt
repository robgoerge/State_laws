980.01 History
History:  1993 a. 479; 1995 a. 27 s. 9126 (19); 1997 a. 284, 295; 2003 a. 187; 2005 a. 277, 2005 a. 434 ss. 60 to 73; 2007 a. 20 s. 9121 (6) (a); 2007 a. 96, 97; 2013 a. 84.980.01 Annotation
Chapter 980 creates a civil commitment procedure primarily intended to provide treatment and protect the public, not to punish the offender.  As such the chapter does not provide for "punishment" in violation of the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy or ex post facto laws.  State v. Carpenter, 197 Wis. 2d 252, 541 N.W.2d 105 (1995), 94-1898.980.01 Annotation
Chapter 980 does not violate substantive due process guarantees.  The definitions of "mental disorder" and "dangerous" are not overbroad.  The treatment obligations under ch. 980 are consistent with the nature and duration of commitments under the chapter.  The lack of a precommitment finding of treatability is not offensive to due process requirements.  State v. Post, 197 Wis. 2d 279, 541 N.W.2d 115 (1995), 94-2356.980.01 Annotation
Chapter 980 does not violate equal protection guarantees.  The state's compelling interest in protecting the public justifies the differential treatment of the sexually violent persons subject to the chapter.  State v. Post, 197 Wis. 2d 279, 541 N.W.2d 115 (1995), 94-2356.980.01 Annotation
A child enticement conviction under a statute that had been repealed and recreated under a new statute number was a sexually violent offense under sub. (6), although the former number was not listed in the new statute.  State v. Irish, 210 Wis. 2d 107, 565 N.W.2d 161 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-2303.980.01 Annotation
Under [former] sub. (7), a "mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence" is a disorder that predisposes the affected person to sexual violence.  A diagnosis of "antisocial personality disorder," uncoupled with any other diagnosis but coupled with sufficient evidence establishing that a defendant is a "sexually violent person," may constitute a mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence under [former] sub. (7).  State v. Adams, 223 Wis. 2d 60, 588 N.W.2d 336 (Ct. App. 1998), 96-3136.980.01 Annotation
Definitions in ch. 980 serve a legal, and not medical, function.  The court will not adopt a definition of pedophilia for ch. 980 purposes.  State v. Zanelli, 223 Wis. 2d 545, 589 N.W.2d 687 (Ct. App. 1998), 98-0733. Down
