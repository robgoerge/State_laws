109.01
109.01â€ƒ
Definitions.  As used in this chapter:
109.01(1)
(1)â€‚"Department" means the department of workforce development.
109.01(1r)

109.01(2)
(2)â€‚Except as provided in ss. 109.07 (1) (d) and 109.075 (1) (c), "employer" means any person engaged in any activity, enterprise or business employing one or more persons within the state, including the state and its political subdivisions and charitable, nonprofit or tax-exempt organizations and institutions.

109.01 History
History:  1975 c. 380, 421; 1989 a. 44; 1995 a. 27 s. 9130 (4); 1997 a. 3, 39, 237; 2003 a. 63.109.01 Annotation
"Wages" does not include salary owed under a fixed term contract to a discharged employee for the period from the discharge to the end of the contract.  DILHR v. Coatings, Inc. 126 Wis. 2d 338, 375 N.W.2d 834 (1985).109.01 Annotation
Sub. (3) includes vacation pay, supplemental unemployment benefit plan payments, severance pay or dismissal pay as wages.  Sub. (3) does not require that the employee perform actual work during the time period for which he is making a wage claim.  Such a requirement would foreclose any employees' wage claims for vacation pay, supplemental unemployment benefit plan payments, severance pay, or dismissal pay because in each case the employee is not performing actual work during the time period of the claim.  Sliwinski v. City of Milwaukee, 2009 WI App 162, 321 Wis. 2d 774, 777 N.W.2d 88, 08-2141.109.03

Employees engaged in logging operations and farm labor shall be paid all earned wages no less often than at regular quarterly intervals.  Any employee who is absent at the time fixed for payment or who for any other reason is not paid at that time shall be paid thereafter at any time upon 6 days' demand.

An employee who brings an action against an employer under this subsection shall have a lien upon all property of the employer, real or personal, located in this state as described in s. 109.09 (2).
109.03(6)
(6)â€‚Wage claim.  In an action by an employee or the department against the employer on a wage claim, no security for payment of costs is required.

No person other than an employee or the department shall be benefited or otherwise affected by this subsection.
109.03(7)

109.03 History
History:  1975 c. 380, 421; 1977 c. 26, 235, 447; 1981 c. 20, 388; 1987 a. 403; 1989 a. 226, 228; 1993 a. 86, 144; 2001 a. 102, 103; 2007 a. 7, 195; 2009 a. 28; 2011 a. 10; 2015 a. 55.109.03 Annotation
The award of "expenses" under sub. (6) may include attorney fees.  Jacobson v. American Tool Cos., Inc. 222 Wis. 2d 384, 588 N.W.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1998), 97-2219.109.03 Annotation
The inclusion of "the state" in the definition of employer at s. 109.01 (2) and the creation of a private cause of action against employers under sub. (5) is a waiver of the state's sovereign immunity.  Claims under statutes enumerated in s. 109.09 (1) may be enforced by a private action brought under sub. (5).  German v. DOT, 223 Wis. 2d 525, 589 N.W.2d 651 (Ct. App. 1998), 98-0250.109.03 AnnotationAffirmed.  2000 WI 62, 235 Wis. 2d 576, 612 N.W.2d 50, 98-0250.109.03 Annotation
When an employer repudiates the contractual remedies of a collective bargaining agreement, employees are allowed to proceed under ch. 109 if they are seeking back pay.  Beaudette v. Eau Claire Cty Sheriff's Department, 2003 WI App 153, 265 Wis. 2d 744, 668 N.W.2d 133, 02-2916.109.03 AnnotationAttorney fees are awardable under sub. (6).  Jackman v. WMAC Inv. Corp. 610 F. Supp. 290 (1985).109.03 Annotation
In determining a reasonable attorney fee under sub. (6), a court starts by determining a reasonable hourly rate and number of hours, then makes adjustments for other factors in SCR 20:1.5 (a) or any other relevant factors.  The court may use its own firsthand knowledge of the proceeding in determining the number of hours reasonably expended.  The amount recovered in itself is not a reason to reduce a fee below an amount that represents a reasonable hourly rate.  Lynch v. Crossroads Counseling Center, Inc. 2004 WI App 114, 275 Wis. 2d 171, 684 N.W.2d 141, 03-1344.109.03 Annotation
Sub. (5) establishes a distinct cause of action and enforcement procedure for a wage claim, wholly apart from any contract claims.  Merely pleading a contract action based on nonpayment of wages is insufficient to trigger a ch. 109 wage claim under notice pleading.  Wolnak v. Cardiovascular & Thoracic Surgeons of Central Wisconsin, S.C. 2005 WI App 217, 287 Wis. 2d 560, 706 N.W.2d 667, 04-1051.109.03 Annotation
Appellate courts ordinarily defer to a circuit court's determination as to hours awarded in allowing attorney fees.  An attorney's hours are subject to the scrutiny of the circuit court and unreasonable hours should not be compensated.  Nonetheless, the appellate courts must probe the circuit court's explanation to determine if the court employed a logical rationale based on the appropriate legal principles and facts of record.  The record should show that the circuit court did not eyeball the fee request and cut it down by an arbitrary percentage because it seemed excessive.  Johnson v. Roma II â€” Waterford LLC, 2013 WI App 38, 346 Wis. 2d 612, 829 N.W.2d 538, 12-1028.109.03 Annotation
Wisconsin requires time spent donning and doffing safety gear to be compensated at the minimum wage or higher, and that this time counts toward the limit after which the overtime rate kicks in.  Wisconsin law is not preempted by federal law.  Spoerle v. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. 614 F.3d 427 (2010).109.07
