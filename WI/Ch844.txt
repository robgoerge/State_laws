Physical injury to, or interference with, real property. 844.01(1)(1)â€‚Any person owning or claiming an interest in real property may bring an action claiming physical injury to, or interference with, the property or the person's interest therein; the action may be to redress past injury, to restrain further injury, to abate the source of injury, or for other appropriate relief.
844.01(2)
(2)â€‚Physical injury includes unprivileged intrusions and encroachments; the injury may be surface, subsurface or suprasurface; the injury may arise from activities on the plaintiff's property, or from activities outside the plaintiff's property which affect plaintiff's property.

(3)â€‚Interference with an interest is any activity other than physical injury which lessens the possibility of use or enjoyment of the interest.
844.01(4)
(4)â€‚The lessening of a security interest without physical injury is not actionable unless such lessening constitutes waste.
