625.11â€ƒ
Rate standards. 625.11(1)(1)â€‚
General.  Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, nor shall an insurer charge any rate which if continued will have or tend to have the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly.
625.11(2)
(2)â€‚Excessiveness. 625.11(2)(a)(a) 
Competitive market.  Rates are presumed not to be excessive if a reasonable degree of price competition exists at the consumer level with respect to the class of business to which they apply.  In determining whether a reasonable degree of price competition exists, the commissioner shall consider all relevant tests including:
625.11(2)(a)1.
1.  The number of insurers actively engaged in the class of business;
625.11(2)(a)2.
2.  The existence of rate differentials in that class of business;
625.11(2)(a)3.
3.  Whether long-run profitability for insurers generally of the class of business is unreasonably high in relation to its riskiness.
625.11(2)(b)
(b) 
Noncompetitive market.  If such competition does not exist, rates are excessive if they are likely to produce a long run profit that is unreasonably high in relation to the riskiness of the class of business, or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to the services rendered.
625.11(3)
(3)â€‚Inadequacy.  Rates are inadequate if they are clearly insufficient, together with the investment income attributable to them, to sustain projected losses and expenses in the class of business to which they apply.
