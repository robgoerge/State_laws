902.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 59 Wis. 2d R1, R23 (1973); 1999 a. 85.902.01 Annotation
When evidence was in conflict as to whether a substance found in the defendant's possession was heroin, the judge could not take judicial notice of other sources without proper notice to the parties.  State v. Barnes, 52 Wis. 2d 82, 187 N.W.2d 845 (1971).
902.01 Annotation
The supreme court cannot take judicial notice of proceedings in a court other than that from which the appeal is taken.  Perkins v. State, 61 Wis. 2d 341, 212 N.W.2d 141 (1973).
902.01 Annotation
The supreme court declined to take judicial notice of the suggested fact that other employment of a like character was available to wrongfully suspended employees.  State ex rel. Schilling & Klingler v. Baird, 65 Wis. 2d 394, 222 N.W.2d 666 (1974).902.01 Annotation
An affidavit on file in another case does not meet the standards regarding judicial notice of facts outside of the record.  Kornitz v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. 81 Wis. 2d 322, 260 N.W.2d 680 (1978).902.01 Annotation
Courts may take judicial notice of the reliability of underlying principles of speed radar detection.  State v. Hanson, 85 Wis. 2d 233, 270 N.W.2d 212 (1978).902.01 Annotation
A court properly took judicial notice of the fact that rapid consumption of 1/2 quart of liquor probably caused a girl's death.  State ex rel. Cholka v. Johnson, 96 Wis. 2d 704, 292 N.W.2d 835 (1980).902.01 Annotation
The trial court erred by relying on its own experience in determining whether a demonstrative videotape was admissible as the judge's opinion was not part of the record or a generally known fact suitable for judicial notice.  State v. Peterson, 222 Wis. 2d 449, 588 N.W.2d 84 (Ct. App. 1998), 97-3737.902.01 Annotation
A jury instruction under sub. (7) directing the jury to accept a judicially-noticed fact as true when applied to an element of a criminal offense eliminates the jury's opportunity to reach an independent, beyond-a-reasonable-doubt decision on that element and is constitutional error, although it is subject to harmless error analysis.  State v. Harvey, 2002 WI 93, 254 Wis. 2d 442, 647 N.W.2d 189, 00-0541.902.01 Annotation
Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding.  This means that an appellate court may take judicial notice when it is appropriate.  A party against whom the taking of judicial notice is sought must have a chance to object as to whether the matters are capable of indisputable proof and, therefore, subject to the taking of judicial notice.  Sisson v. Hansen Storage Company, 2008 WI App 111, 313 Wis. 2d 411, 756 N.W.2d 667, 07-1426.902.01 Annotation

902.02(3)
(3)â€‚Determined by court; ruling reviewable.  The determination of such laws shall be made by the court and not by the jury, and shall be reviewable.
902.02(4)

Any party may also present to the trial court any admissible evidence of such laws, but, to enable a party to offer evidence of the law in another jurisdiction or to ask that judicial notice be taken thereof, reasonable notice shall be given to the adverse parties either in the pleadings or otherwise.
