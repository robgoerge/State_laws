630.05 History
History:  1979 c. 102; 1983 a. 189 s. 329 (25); 1983 a. 274; 2015 a. 117.630.05 Annotation
Legislative Council Note, 1979: This section provides a convenient cross-reference to the general corporate provision and makes clear that it applies to all types of insurers.  It replaces s. 610.55 which applied only to life insurance companies.  That section was originally enacted by ch. 343, laws of 1906.  Apparently, the provision has been generally ignored since that time, except for the filing of a special schedule to annual statements.  A reason for ignoring the section appears to be the action of the 1905 legislature in passing a general prohibition against political contributions [ch. 492, laws of 1905].  [Bill 146-S]
630.10
630.10â€ƒ
Lobbying. Subchapter III of ch. 13 applies to all persons subject to regulation under chs. 600 to 655.
630.10 History
History:  1979 c. 102; 1981 c. 314; 1989 a. 187 s. 29.630.10 Annotation
Legislative Council Note, 1979: This section provides a convenient cross-reference to the laws regulating lobbying generally and makes clear that it applies to persons regulated under the insurance code.
630.10 Annotation
It replaces s. 610.57 which applied only to life insurance companies.  Section 610.57 has been a part of the statutes since passage of ch. 131, laws of 1907.  It has been largely ignored in the belief that the general lobbying laws applied to insurance companies and others concerned with insurance matters, especially since adoption of ch. 609, laws of 1947, creating ss. 13.60 to 13.73. [Bill 146-S]
630.15
630.15â€ƒ
Prohibited relationships between life insurers and funeral directors or cemeteries.  No life insurer may invest directly in or, except as a loan secured by a mortgage on real estate or as a policy loan, lend money to a funeral director or cemetery or any association of funeral directors or cemeteries.  No funeral director or cemetery or association of funeral directors or cemeteries may control a life insurer.
