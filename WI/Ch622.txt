622.11(2)
(2)â€‚Partial exemption. 622.11(2)(a)(a)  If an insurer that is a member of an insurance holding company system qualifies for exemption under sub.

(1) (b), the summary report required under s. 622.09 shall include every insurer within the insurance holding company system.  An insurer may satisfy this requirement by submitting more than one summary report for any combination of insurers, provided that any combination of summary reports includes every insurer within the insurance holding company system.
622.11(2)(b)

(1) (a), but the insurance holding company system of which the insurer is a member qualifies for exemption under sub.

622.11(3)
(3)â€‚Waiver.  An insurer that does not qualify for exemption under sub. (1) may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this chapter.  In determining whether to grant the waiver, the commissioner may consider the type and volume of business written by the insurer, the ownership and organizational structure of the insurer, and any other factor the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance holding company system of which the insurer is a member.  If the insurer is part of an insurance holding company system that includes insurers domiciled in more than one state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the commissioner of the lead state and with the commissioners of each of the other states in which insurer members of the insurance holding company system are domiciled in determining whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.

(4)â€‚Withdrawal of exemption or waiver.  Notwithstanding subs. (1) and (3), the commissioner may issue an order requiring an insurer to create and maintain a risk management framework, conduct an own risk and solvency assessment, and file a summary report if either of the following applies:
622.11(4)(a)
(a)  The commissioner finds that the insurer's unique circumstances, including the type and volume of business written, the ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests, or international supervisor requests, warrant withdrawal of the exemption or waiver.  If the commissioner withdraws the exemption or waiver, the insurer or the insurance holding company system is subject to the requirement under s. 622.09 until the commissioner reinstates the exemption under sub. (1) or the waiver under sub. (3).
622.11(4)(b)
(b)  The insurer has a risk-based capital company action level event, as defined in s. Ins 51.01 (4), Wis. Adm.

622.11(5)
(5)â€‚Compliance after loss of exemption.  If an insurer no longer qualifies for an exemption under sub. (1) due to increased premium, as reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance holding company system of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one year following the year in which the premium threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
