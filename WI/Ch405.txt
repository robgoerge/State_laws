(3)â€‚With the exception of this subsection, subs. (1) and (4), ss. 405.102 (1) (i) and (j), 405.106 (4) and 405.114 (4), and except to the extent prohibited in ss. 401.302 and 405.117 (4), the effect of this chapter may be varied by agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking.
