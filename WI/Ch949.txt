CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION

949.001â€ƒ
Legislative intent.  The legislature finds and declares that the state has a moral responsibility to aid innocent victims of violent crime.  In order to maintain and to strengthen our democratic system of law and social order, it is essential that the rights of the victim of a crime should be as fully protected as the rights of the criminal offender.  Adequate protection and assistance of victims of crime will also encourage greater public cooperation in the successful apprehension and prosecution of criminal offenders.  It is the intention of the legislature that the state should provide sufficient assistance to victims of crime and their families in order to ease their financial burden and to maintain their dignity as they go through a difficult and often traumatic period.  It is also the intention of the legislature that the department should actively publicize the crime victim compensation program and promote its use.
