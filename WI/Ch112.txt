112.01(3)
(3)â€‚Application of payments made to fiduciaries.  A person who in good faith pays or transfers to a fiduciary any money or other property which the fiduciary as such is authorized to receive, is not responsible for the proper application thereof by the fiduciary; and any right or title acquired from the fiduciary in consideration of such payment or transfer is not invalid in consequence of a misapplication by the fiduciary.
112.01(5)
(5)â€‚Transfer of negotiable instrument by fiduciary.  If any negotiable instrument payable or endorsed to a fiduciary as such is endorsed by the fiduciary, or if any negotiable instrument payable or endorsed to a fiduciary's principal is endorsed by a fiduciary empowered to endorse such instrument on behalf of his or her principal, the endorsee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in endorsing or delivering the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary, unless the endorsee takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that the endorsee's action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.  If, however, such instrument is transferred by the fiduciary in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to the actual knowledge of the creditor, or is transferred in any transaction known by the transferee to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, the creditor or other transferee is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument.
112.01(6)
(6)â€‚Check drawn by fiduciary payable to 3rd person.  If a check or other bill of exchange is drawn by a fiduciary as such, or in the name of a fiduciary's principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw such instrument in the name of his or her principal, the payee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary unless the payee takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach, or with knowledge of such facts that the payee's action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.  If, however, such instrument is payable to a personal creditor of the fiduciary and delivered to the creditor in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to the actual knowledge of the creditor, or is drawn and delivered in any transaction known by the payee to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, the creditor or other payee is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument.
112.01(7)
(7)â€‚Check drawn by and payable to fiduciary.  If a check or other bill of exchange is drawn by a fiduciary as such, or in the name of a fiduciary's principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw such instrument in the name of his or her principal, payable to the fiduciary personally, or payable to a 3rd person, and transferred by the 3rd person to the fiduciary, and is thereafter transferred by the fiduciary, whether in payment of a personal debt of the fiduciary or otherwise, the transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary, unless the transferee takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach, or with knowledge of such facts that the transferee's action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.
112.01(8)
(8)â€‚Deposit in name of fiduciary as such.  If a deposit is made in a bank to the credit of a fiduciary as such, the bank is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit or any part thereof upon the check of the fiduciary, signed with the name in which such deposit is entered, without being liable to the principal, unless the bank pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing the check, or with knowledge of such facts that its action in paying the check amounts to bad faith.  If, however, such a check is payable to the drawee bank, and is delivered to it in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to it, the bank is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the check.
112.01(9)
(9)â€‚Deposit in name of principal.  If a check is drawn upon the account of a fiduciary's principal in a bank by a fiduciary, who is empowered to draw checks upon his or her principal's account, the bank is authorized to pay such check without being liable to the principal, unless the bank pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing such check, or with knowledge of such facts that its action in paying the check amounts to bad faith.  If, however, such a check is payable to the drawee bank and is delivered to it in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to it, the bank is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary's obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the check.
112.01(10)
(10)â€‚Deposit in fiduciary's personal account.  If a fiduciary makes a deposit in a bank to the fiduciary's personal credit of checks drawn by the fiduciary upon an account in his or her own name as fiduciary, or of checks payable to the fiduciary as fiduciary, or of checks drawn by the fiduciary upon an account in the name of his or her principal if the fiduciary is empowered to draw checks thereon, or of checks payable to his or her principal and endorsed by the fiduciary, if the fiduciary is empowered to endorse such checks, or if the fiduciary otherwise makes a deposit of funds held by the fiduciary as fiduciary, the bank receiving such deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his or her obligation as fiduciary.  The bank is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit or any part thereof upon the personal check of the fiduciary, including checks payable to the bank, without being liable to the principal, unless the bank receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his or her obligation as fiduciary in making such deposit or in drawing such check, or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith, and the bank paying the check is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his or her obligation as fiduciary.
112.01(11)
(11)â€‚Deposit or safe deposit box rental in name of estate or two or more fiduciaries.  When a deposit is made in a bank account or a safe deposit box or storage space rented, in the names of 2 or more persons as trustees or personal representatives, or in the name of an estate having 2 or more personal representatives, and a check is drawn upon the account, or access to the safe deposit box or storage space is sought by any one or more of the fiduciaries authorized by the other fiduciary or fiduciaries to draw checks upon the account, or to enter the safe deposit box or storage space, neither the payee nor the other holder nor the bank is bound to inquire whether it is a breach of trust to authorize the fiduciary or fiduciaries to draw checks upon the account, or to enter the safe deposit box or storage space, and is not liable unless the circumstances are such that the action of the payee or other holder or the bank amounts to bad faith.
112.01(12)

112.01 History
History:  1975 c. 409; 1979 c. 89; 1981 c. 391 s. 210; 1983 a. 189; 1993 a. 112, 492; 1997 a. 253; 2001 a. 102; 2005 a. 253.112.01 Annotation
Actual knowledge or bad faith is a precondition for liability under sub. (6).  Bolger v. Merrill Lynch Ready Assets Trust, 143 Wis. 2d 766, 423 N.W.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1988).
112.01 Annotation
Sub. (10) applies when a person is actually acting as a fiduciary and the bank is aware that it is dealing with a fiduciary.  If these facts are not present, the defenses contained in sub. (10) do not apply.  Larson v. Kleist Builders, Ltd. 203 Wis. 2d 341, 553 N.W.2d 281 (Ct. App. 1996), 95-2235.112.01 Annotation
The 6-year limitations period found in s. 893.93 (1) (a) applies to actions under this section.  Willowglen Academy-Wisconsin, Inc. v. Connelly Interiors, Inc. 2008 WI App 35, 307 Wis. 2d 776, 746 N.W.2d 570, 07-1178.112.01 Annotation
Sub. (6) imposes no requirement that a personal creditor who receives a check drawn by a fiduciary know the exact fiduciary relationship.  Willowglen Academy-Wisconsin, Inc. v. Connelly Interiors, Inc. 2008 WI App 35, 307 Wis. 2d 776, 746 N.W.2d 570, 07-1178.112.01 Annotation
Sub. (6) pertains to checks drawn by a fiduciary as such, or in the name of a fiduciary's principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw the instrument in the name of the principal.  To "draw" under sub. (6) does not equate solely with the act of personally signing the instrument in question.  Here, the fiduciary "drew" checks by using a check machine and a facsimile stamp containing the signatures of the employing company's copresidents.  Willowglen Academy-Wisconsin, Inc. v. Connelly Interiors, Inc. 2008 WI App 35, 307 Wis. 2d 776, 746 N.W.2d 570, 07-1178.112.02

If the suspension of the fiduciary will leave no person acting as fiduciary, or will leave the sole beneficiary of a trust as the only acting trustee of the trust, the petition must pray for the appointment of a successor unless a successor has been named in the will and the named successor is not engaged in war service or is not for other reasons unable or unwilling to act as a fiduciary.
112.02(3)
(3)â€‚Where the application is made by a fiduciary engaged in war service notice shall be given to such persons and in such manner as the presiding judge may direct.  Where the application is made by any other person interested in the estate or fund and the fiduciary is in the military or naval service of the United States notice shall be given to such fiduciary in such manner as the judge may direct.

The decree may further provide that the remaining fiduciary or, if there is none, the successor named in the will or appointed by the court is possessed of and may exercise all of the powers and duties incidental to the person's office as fiduciary.
112.02(5)
(5)â€‚112.02(5)(a)(a)  When the suspended fiduciary ceases to be engaged in war service the suspended fiduciary may be reinstated if any of the duties of the office remain unexecuted, upon application to the court and upon any notice that the presiding judge of the court directs.  Upon reinstatement of the suspended fiduciary, the court shall remove the suspended fiduciary's successor and revoke the successor fiduciary's letters, and make any other order or decree that justice requires.
112.02(5)(b)
(b)  Removal and revocation of letters under par. (a) shall not bar the successor from again qualifying as a fiduciary in accordance with the provisions of the will or if for any reason the appointment of a successor fiduciary is required subsequently.

The records of the fiduciary and the records of the bank or trust company acting as custodian, as managing agent or as custodian for a fiduciary shall at all times show the name of the party for whose account the securities are so deposited.  Ownership of, and other interests in, the securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of the clearing corporation without physical delivery of certificates representing the securities.
