LEGISLATIVE INTENT
944.01
944.01â€ƒ
Intent.  The state recognizes that it has a duty to encourage high moral standards.  Although the state does not regulate the private sexual activity of consenting adults, the state does not condone or encourage any form of sexual conduct outside the institution of marriage.  Marriage is the foundation of family and society.  Its stability is basic to morality and civilization, and of vital interest to society and this state.

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), did not announce a fundamental right of adults to engage in all forms of private consensual sexual conduct.  There was no clearly established federal law in 2001 that supported defendant's claim that he had a fundamental right to engage in incest free from government proscription.  Muth v.
