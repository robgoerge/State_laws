A prior inconsistent statement by a witness at a criminal trial is admissible under sub. (4) (a) 1. as substantive evidence.  Vogel v. State, 96 Wis. 2d 372, 291 N.W.2d 850 (1980), 94-0822.908.01 Annotation
The admission of a statement by a deceased coconspirator did not violate the right of confrontation and was within sub. (4) (b) 5.  State v. Dorcey, 103 Wis. 2d 152, 307 N.W.2d 612 (1981).908.01 Annotation

The statement of a coconspirator under sub. (4) (b) 5. may be admitted without proof of the declarant's unavailability or a showing of particular indicia of reliability; the court must determine whether circumstances exist warranting exclusion.  State v. Webster, 156 Wis. 2d 510, 458 N.W.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1990).908.01 Annotation

908.01 Annotation
When a person relies on a translator for communication, the statements of the translator are regarded as the speaker's for hearsay purposes.  State v. Patino, 177 Wis. 2d 348, 502 N.W.2d 601 (Ct. App. 1993).908.01 Annotation
The admissibility of one inconsistent sentence under sub. (4) (a) 1. does not bring the declarant's entire statement within the scope of that rule.  Wikrent v. Toys "R" Us, 179 Wis. 2d 297, 507 N.W.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1993).908.01 Annotation
While polygraph tests are inadmissible, post-polygraph interviews, found distinct both as to time and content from the examination that preceded them and the statements made therein, are admissible.  State v. Johnson, 193 Wis. 2d 382, 535 Wis. 2d 441 (Ct. App. 1995).  See also State v. Greer, 2003 WI App 112, 265 Wis. 2d 463, 666 N.W.2d 518, 01-2591.908.01 Annotation
There must be facts that support a reasonable conclusion that a defendant has "embraced the truth" of someone else's statement as a condition precedent to finding an adoptive admission under sub. (4) (b) 2.  State v. Rogers, 196 Wis. 2d 817, 539 N.W.2d 897 (Ct. App. 1995), 94-1912.908.01 Annotation
Statements made by a prosecutor, not under oath, in a prior proceeding may be considered admissions if: 1) the court is convinced the prior statement is inconsistent with the statement at the later trial; 2) the statements are the equivalent of testimonial statements; and 3) the inconsistency is a fair one and an innocent explanation does not exist.  State v. Cardenas-Hernandez, 214 Wis. 2d 71, 571 N.W.2d 406 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-3605.908.01 Annotation
A party's use of an out-of-court statement to show an inconsistency does not automatically give the opposing party the right to introduce the whole statement.  Under the rule of completeness, the court has discretion to admit only those statements necessary to provide context and prevent distortion.  State v. Eugenio, 219 Wis. 2d 391, 579 N.W.2d 642 (1998), 96-1394.908.01 Annotation
To use a prior consistent statement under sub. (4) (a) 2., the proponent must show that the statement predated the alleged recent fabrication and that there was an express or implied charge of fabrication at trial.  Ansani v. Cascade Mountain, Inc. 223 Wis. 2d 39, 588 N.W.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1998), 97-3514.908.01 Annotation
Although s. 907.03 allows an expert to base an opinion on hearsay, it does not transform the testimony into admissible evidence.  The court must determine when the underlying hearsay may reach the trier of fact through examination of the expert, with cautioning instructions, and when it must be excluded altogether.  State v. Watson, 227 Wis. 2d 167, 595 N.W.2d 403 (1999), 95-1067.908.01 Annotation
When a criminal defendant objects to testimony of his or her out-of-court statement as incomplete or attempts to cross-examine the witness on additional parts of the statement, the court must make a discretionary determination regarding completeness as required by Eugenio.  Additional portions of the defendant's statement are not inadmissible solely because the defendant chooses not to testify.  State v. Anderson, 230 Wis. 2d 121, 600 N.W.2d 913 (Ct. App. 1999), 98-3639.908.01 Annotation
An "assertion" under sub. (1) is an expression of a fact, condition, or opinion.  Nothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.  An instruction to do something is not an assertion when offered to prove that the instruction was given and to explain the effect on the person to whom the instruction was given, but an expression of a fact, opinion, or condition that is implicit in the words of an utterance, as long as the speaker intended to express that fact, opinion, or condition is an assertion.  The burden is on the party claiming that an utterance contains an implicit assertion to show that a particular expression of fact, opinion, or condition was intended by the speaker.  State v. Kutz, 2003 WI App 205, 267 Wis. 2d 531, 671 N.W.2d 660, 02-1670.908.01 Annotation
Sub. (4) (b) deals with admissions by a party as a general rule, but admissions incidental to an offer to plead are a special kind of party admission: they are impossible to segregate from the offer itself because the offer is implicit in the reasons advanced therefor.  Section 904.10 trumps sub. (4) (b) because it excludes only this particular category of party admissions and therefore is more specialized than the latter statute.  State v. Norwood, 2005 WI App 218, 287 Wis. 2d 679, 706 N.W.2d 683, 04-1073.908.01 Annotation
A statement is made in furtherance of a conspiracy under sub. (4) (b) 5. when the statement is part of the information flow between conspirators intended to help each perform his or her role.  A statement of a coconspirator that is not hearsay may be used as evidence against another member of the conspiracy.  State v. Savanh, 2005 WI App 245, 287 Wis. 2d 876, 707 N.W.2d 549, 04-2583.908.01 Annotation
When there was evidence in the record that the defendant approved his attorney's letter to the alleged victim, the letter fell clearly within sub. (4) (b) 3. as a "statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject."  State v. Adamczak, 2013 WI App 150, 352 Wis. 2d 34, 841 N.W.2d 311, 13-0310.908.01 Annotation
The existence of a conspiracy under sub. (4) (b) 5. must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence by the party offering the statement.  Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171 (1987).908.01 Annotation
Under sub. (4) (b) 4., a party introducing the statement of an agent as the admission of a principal need not show that the agent had authority to speak for the principal.  The rule only requires that the agent's statement concern "a matter within the scope of his agency or employment."  Perzinski v. Chevron Chemical Co. 503 F. 2d 654.908.01 Annotation
Bourjaily v. United States: New rule for admitting coconspirator hearsay statements.  1988 WLR 577 (1988).
