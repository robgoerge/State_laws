174.001 History
History:  1979 c. 289 ss. 8m, 17; 1983 a. 451; 1995 a. 79, 316; 1997 a. 35; 2001 a. 16, 56; 2003 a. 133.174.001 Annotation
The casual presence of a dog on someone's property does not make that person a "keeper."  "Harboring" a dog means to afford it lodging, to shelter it, or give it refuge; it does not include the transient presence in one's home of another's dog.  Pattermann v. Pattermann, 173 Wis. 2d 143, 496 N.W.2d 613 (Ct. App. 1992).174.001 Annotation
There is a distinction between "keeping" and "harboring."  Keeping generally requires exercising some measure of care, custody, or control over the dog, while harboring is often defined as sheltering or giving refuge to a dog.  Thus, harboring lacks the proprietary aspect of keeping.  However, the concepts of "harbor" and "keep" are similar, and the liability of one who harbors a dog and one who keeps a dog is the same.  Pawlowski v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co. 2009 WI 105, 322 Wis. 2d 21, 777 N.W.2d 67, 07-2651.174.001 Annotation
The relevant consideration in deciding a question of "harboring" is whether the owner of the home knowingly afforded lodging and shelter to the dog.  That an owner resided in a separate home from the dog and was not in a convenient position to and in fact did not exercise custody or control over or care for the dog, would be most relevant if the issue was whether the owner was a "keeper" of the dog, but not a harborer.  Augsburger v. Homestead Mutual Insurance Company, 2013 WI App 106, 350 Wis. 2d 486, 838 N.W.2d 88, 12-0641.174.01
