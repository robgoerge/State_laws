Statewide concern; uniformity. 104.001(1)
(1)â€‚The legislature finds that the provision of a minimum wage that is uniform throughout the state is a matter of statewide concern and that the enactment of a minimum wage ordinance by a city, village, town, or county would be logically inconsistent with, would defeat the purpose of, and would go against the spirit of this chapter.  Therefore, this chapter shall be construed as an enactment of statewide concern for the purpose of providing a minimum wage that is uniform throughout the state.
104.001(2)
(2)â€‚A city, village, town, or county may not enact and administer an ordinance establishing a minimum wage.  Any city, village, town, or county minimum wage ordinance that is in effect on June 16, 2005, is void.
104.001(3)
(3)â€‚This section does not affect an ordinance that, subject to s. 66.0903, requires an employee of a county, city, village, or town, an employee who performs work under a contract for the provision of services to a county, city, village, or town, or an employee who performs work that is funded by financial assistance from a county, city, village, or town, to be paid at a minimum wage rate specified in the ordinance.
