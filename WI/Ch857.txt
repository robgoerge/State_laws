857.01â€ƒ
Ownership in personal representative; management and control.  Upon his or her letters being issued by the court, the personal representative succeeds to the interest of the decedent in all property of the decedent.  The personal representative or surviving spouse may petition the court for an order determining the classification of property under ch. 766, and for other equitable relief necessary for management and control of the marital property during the administration of the estate.  The court may make any decree under ch. 766, including a decree that the property be titled in accordance with its classification, to assist the personal representative or surviving spouse in managing and controlling the marital property and the decedent's property other than marital property during administration of the estate.  During administration, the management and control rules under s. 766.51 apply to the property of a decedent spouse which is subject to administration and to the property of the surviving spouse.  With regard to property subject to the election of the surviving spouse under s. 861.02, the personal representative may manage and control the property while the property is subject to administration.  The personal representative shall determine when, during administration, property shall be distributed to satisfy an election under s. 861.02.

The holding spouse shall identify in a will or other signed writing the property described under s. 766.70 (3) (a), (b) or (d) to which the directive applies.  The signature of the holding spouse on a directive other than a will shall be acknowledged, attested or witnessed under s. 706.07.  The estate of the holding spouse may not execute a directive under this section.  If at the death of a spouse the surviving spouse is the holding spouse, the surviving spouse may execute a directive under this section if executed within 90 days after the decedent spouse's death.

857.03 Annotation
As the holder of legal title to the assets of the estate, the personal representative has standing to bring a constitutional challenge against the statute upon which the claim of the appellant is based.  Estate of Peterson, 66 Wis. 2d 535, 225 N.W.2d 644 (1975).857.03 Annotation
The personal representative's failure to inform the trial court that the high bidders in a sale of the testator's property had been occasional clients did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty when the sale was publicly advertised, conducted under sealed bid, and authorized as to procedure by both the court and estate beneficiaries.  Estate of Philbrick, 68 Wis. 2d 776, 229 N.W.2d 573 91975).857.03 Annotation
In the absence of a statute or a decedent's written directions, the burden of the federal and state estate taxes attributable to probate and nonprobate assets falls on the residue of the estate.  The rationale for the "residuary rule" has generally been that the decedent intended property transferred outside probate to be free of the usual burdens imposed on the probate estate.  Estate of Sheppard v. Schleis, 2010 WI 32, 324 Wis. 2d 41, 782 N.W.2d 85, 09-1021.857.035

The court may allow as costs the sum paid by a personal representative on any bond or undertaking given by the personal representative in the case.

Procedure which may be followed when personal representative fails to perform.  If a personal representative fails to perform an act or file a document within the time required by statute or order of the court the court upon its own motion or upon the petition of any person interested may order the personal representative for the estate and his or her attorney to show cause why the act has not been performed or the document has not been filed and shall mail a copy of the order to the sureties on the bond of the personal representative.  If cause is not shown the court shall determine who is at fault.  If both are at fault, the court may dismiss both and then appoint a personal representative and appoint an attorney acceptable to the personal representative to complete the administration of the estate.  If only the personal representative is at fault, he or she may be summarily dismissed and in that event the court shall then appoint another personal representative to complete the administration and close the estate.  If only the attorney is at fault, the court may dismiss the attorney and instruct the personal representative to employ another attorney; if the personal representative fails to employ another attorney within 30 days, the court shall appoint an attorney.  No other procedure for substitution of attorney is required in such cases.  The procedure set forth in this section is not exclusive.
