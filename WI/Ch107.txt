(1)â€‚"Exploration mining lease" means any lease, option to lease, option to purchase or similar conveyance entered into for the purpose of determining the presence, location, quality or quantity of nonferrous metallic minerals or for the purpose of mining, developing or extracting nonferrous metallic minerals, or both under ch. 293.  Any lease, option to lease, option to purchase or similar conveyance entered into by a mining company is rebuttably presumed to be an exploration mining lease.
107.001(3)
(3)â€‚"Mining company" means any person or agent of a person who has a prospecting or mining permit under s. 293.45 or 293.49.

107.01â€ƒ
Rules governing mining rights.  Where there is no contract between the parties or terms established by the landlord to the contrary the following rules and regulations shall be applied to mining contracts and leases for the digging of nonferrous metallic minerals:
107.01(1)
(1)â€‚No license or lease, verbal or written, made to a miner shall be revocable by the maker thereof after a valuable discovery or prospect has been struck unless the miner shall forfeit the miner's right by negligence such as establishes a forfeiture according to mining usages.
107.01(2)
(2)â€‚The discovery of a crevice or range containing nonferrous metallic minerals shall entitle the discoverer to the nonferrous metallic minerals pertaining thereto, subject to the rent due the discoverer's landlord, before as well as after the nonferrous metallic minerals are separated from the freehold; but such miner shall not be entitled to recover any nonferrous metallic minerals or the value thereof from the person digging on the miner's range in good faith and known to be mining thereon until the miner shall have given notice of the miner's claim; and the miner shall be entitled to the nonferrous metallic minerals dug after such notice.
107.01(3)
(3)â€‚Usages and customs among miners may be proved in explanation of mining contracts to the same extent as usage may be proved in other branches of business.

Mining statement; penalty.  When there is no agreement between the parties to any mining lease, license or permit, to mine or remove nonferrous metallic minerals from any lands in this state, regulating the method of reporting the amount of nonferrous metallic minerals taken, the person mining and removing the nonferrous metallic minerals shall keep proper and correct books, and therefrom to make and deliver by or before the fifteenth day of each month to the lessor, owner or person entitled thereto, a detailed statement covering the operations of the preceding month.  The statement shall show the total amount of tons or pounds of each kind of nonferrous metallic minerals produced; if sold, then to whom sold, giving the date of sale, date of delivery to any railroad company, naming the company, and the station where delivered or billed for shipment; the name and address of the purchaser; the price per ton at which sold and the total value of each kind of nonferrous metallic minerals so sold.  The books shall be always open to any owner, lessor, licensor or stockholder, if the owner, lessor or licensor is a corporation, and to any person or stockholder interested in any such mining operations, for the purpose of inspection and taking copies thereof or abstracts therefrom.  Any person and every officer, agent or employee of any thereof, who violates this section, or who makes any false or incomplete entries on any such books or statements, shall be fined not less than $100 or imprisoned in the county jail for not more than 3 months or both.

Conflicting claims.  In case of conflicting claims to a crevice or range bearing nonferrous metallic minerals the court may continue any action to enforce a claim or grant any necessary time for the purpose of allowing parties to prove up their mines or diggings if it satisfactorily appears necessary to the ends of justice.  In such case the court or judge may appoint a receiver and provide that the mines or diggings be worked under the receiver's direction, subject to the order of the court, in such manner as best ascertains the respective rights of the parties.  The nonferrous metallic minerals raised by either party pending the dispute shall be delivered to the receiver, who may, by order of the court or judge, pay any rent or other necessary expenses therefrom.

If a miner neglects to work his or her mines or diggings according to the usages of miners, without reasonable excuse, he or she shall likewise forfeit the mines or diggings and the landlord may proceed against the miner in like manner to recover possession of the mines or diggings.
