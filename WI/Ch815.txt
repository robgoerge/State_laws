815.02 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 761 (1975); Stats. 1975 s. 815.02; 1993 a. 486.815.02 Annotation
No provision in ch. 815 or case law prevents a land contract vendor from filing a strict foreclosure action or obtaining a judgment of strict foreclosure because a judgment lienholder has already filed an action for foreclosure of a judgment lien and sale of the property nor is their authority that suggests a circuit court has discretion to dismiss a strict foreclosure action for that reason.  The land contract vendor may choose the remedy it wishes to pursue including strict foreclosure.  Republic Bank of Chicago v. Lichosyt, 2007 WI App 150, 303 Wis. 2d 474, 736 N.W.2d 153, 06-1578.815.03
