An otherwise valid lease and sale of personal property executed by the decedent are not claims against the estate subject to the limitations of this section.  In re Estate of Taylor, 81 Wis. 2d 687, 260 N.W.2d 803 (1978).859.02 Annotation
A claim against an estate for personal services rendered during an adulterous relationship with the deceased was allowed under a quasi-contract theory.  In Matter of Estate of Steffes, 95 Wis. 2d 490, 290 N.W.2d 697 (1980).859.02 Annotation
The mere fact that the personal representative corresponded with creditors about accounts payable did not give rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the personal representative to disclose information about filing claims.

859.03â€ƒ
Continuance of separate action.  If an action is pending against a decedent at the time of his or her death and the action survives, the plaintiff in that action may serve a notice of substitution of party defendant on the personal representative and file proof of service of notice in the court.  Filing of proof of service on or before the deadline for filing a claim under s. 859.01 gives the plaintiff the same rights against the estate as the filing of a claim.  A judgment in any such action constitutes an adjudication for or against the estate.
