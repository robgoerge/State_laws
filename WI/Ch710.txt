710.02 Annotation
The rationale of s. 710.02, 1973 stats., which limited nonresident alien ownership of land, was premised upon potential detriment to the welfare of the community and was not so arbitrary as to deny equal protection.  Lehndorff Geneva, Inc. v. Warren, 74 Wis. 2d 369, 246 N.W.2d 815 (1976).710.02 Annotation
Sub. (1) is generally inapplicable to General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) members, their services, or their service suppliers to the extent they seek to acquire, own, or hold land for enumerated service-related uses enumerated in the U.S. Schedule for the agreement.  To the extent they seek to enforce their rights under the GATS, GATS members and their service suppliers, including citizens of and corporations organized under GATS members, are covered by the treaty exception in sub. (2) (b) that exempts "citizens, foreign governments or subjects of a foreign government" from the acreage limitation.  OAG 11-14710.03
