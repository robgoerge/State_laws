Cross-reference:  See also ch. ATCP 94, Wis. adm. code.168.04 Annotation
Legislative Council Note, 1979: Clarifies that the department of industry, labor and human relations has authority to promulgate standards for gasoline-alcohol fuel blends.  The existing requirement that rules be in conformity with nationally recognized standards, including those published by the U.S. environmental protection agency, should ensure that any rules establishing standards for gasoline-alcohol fuel blends are consistent with federal rulings on those additives permitted to be mixed with unleaded gasoline.

Inspection of petroleum products. 168.05(1)

(5), sold, offered for sale or used until a true sample of not less than 8 ounces is taken as provided in this subchapter.  This subsection does not apply if the department has previously inspected the petroleum product at the refinery, marine or pipeline terminal.  Each person importing or receiving a petroleum product which has not been previously inspected shall notify the inspector in the person's district of the receipt thereof, and the inspector shall take a sample of the petroleum product.
168.05(2)
(2)â€‚If such petroleum product is received on a regular business day between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., such notice shall be given forthwith upon receipt of such petroleum product.  If received at any other time, such notice shall be given between the next succeeding hours of 7:45 a.m. and 10 a.m. of a regular business day.

168.05(3)
(3)â€‚If the inspector does not, upon proper notice, after a reasonable length of time, take such sample, the recipient of such petroleum product may, in the presence of a disinterested witness, open such original container and take a true sample of not less than 8 ounces of the contents thereof.  Such sample shall be immediately placed in a clean container which is in compliance with s. 168.11 (2) and (3) and tightly closed.  The recipient shall record upon a label attached to such container the means of conveyance, the type of original container, the product name and quantity of the contents thereof, and such other information as the department reasonably requires for the proper identification of such shipment.  Such sample thus taken shall be held for delivery, upon demand, to the inspector.  After such sample is taken such petroleum product may be unloaded, sold, offered for sale or used the same as if sampled by the inspector.
168.05(4)
(4)â€‚For the purpose of this section, the following shall constitute a reasonable length of time in which an inspector shall take the sample herein required:  If notice is properly given to an inspector before the hour of 11:45 a.m., the inspector shall take such sample before the hour of 4:30 p.m. of the day; if notice is properly given between the hours of 11:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., such sample shall be taken before the hour of 11:45 a.m. of the next following regular business day.  Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, designated in s. 995.20, shall not be considered regular business days.

Powers. 168.06(1)(1)â€‚For the purposes of administering this subchapter, inspectors may take samples of gasoline, gasoline-alcohol fuel blends, kerosene, other refined oils, fuel oils and petroleum distillates for tests and make inspections at any points within or without this state, and may open any original container containing gasoline, gasoline-alcohol fuel blends, kerosene, other refined oils, fuel oils and petroleum distillates and take a true sample of not less than 8 ounces of the contents thereof, even though the original containers may still be in the possession of a common or contract carrier, provided the opening and sampling does not unduly inconvenience or hamper the transportation of the products.  After the original containers are opened and sampled the same shall be resealed with seals furnished by the department for such purposes.  The authority conferred by this section shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any of the provisions of s. 168.05.
168.06(2)
(2)â€‚If any petroleum product is emptied or transferred into any container in which is contained any other grade of petroleum product, then the entire commingling shall be deemed uninspected and a sample of such commingled petroleum product shall be taken before such commingled petroleum product is removed from such container, sold, offered for sale or used.
168.06(3)
(3)â€‚Notice of such commingling of any petroleum products shall be given in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as notice of the receipts of petroleum products as provided in s. 168.05.  The sample of such commingled petroleum products shall be taken by the inspector within a reasonable length of time, as defined and set forth in s. 168.05, after notice.  If such inspector does not take such sample within such time, the commingler shall take a true sample of not less than 8 ounces of the commingled petroleum products.  The taking, sealing and holding of such sample by the commingler shall, so far as applicable, be governed by the provisions of s. 168.05 relating to the same by a person receiving a petroleum product.
