865.01â€ƒ
Applicability of informal administration.  "Informal administration of estates" means the administration of decedents' estates, testate and intestate, without exercise of continuous supervision by the court.  Administrative action by the probate registrar is not action by the court.  Informal administration proceedings are, nevertheless, circuit court proceedings, records of which shall be kept in the same manner as they are kept for formal proceedings; all of the duties and powers of registers in probate, including the certification of papers filed in the probate court, apply to informal proceedings in the same manner as they apply to formal proceedings.  All provisions of chs. 851 to 879 not inconsistent with this chapter shall apply to the informal administration of estates.

Formal proceedings: nature; effect. 865.03(1)
(1)â€‚A formal proceeding in this chapter is a judicial proceeding before the court involving the administration of the estate of a decedent, including a court proceeding concerning the use or availability of this chapter.  It is distinguished from an administrative proceeding before the probate registrar.  Formal proceedings, either as to a particular issue or as to the entire subsequent administration of the estate, may be initiated by the personal representative or by any interested person at any time by a written demand therefor.  Formal proceedings may be demanded by a guardian or guardian ad litem on behalf of an interested person who is a minor or is an individual adjudicated incompetent.
865.03(2)
(2)â€‚A demand for formal proceedings shall be served on the personal representative, if any, and filed with the court.  Service of a demand on the personal representative or, if none is appointed, filing of a demand with the court shall suspend informal administration as to the issues or matters referred to therein and shall suspend the powers of the personal representative in respect thereto until the same are reinstated by the court.

Effect of fraud and evasion.  Whenever fraud has been perpetrated in connection with any proceeding or in any statement filed under this chapter, or if fraud is used to avoid or circumvent the provisions or purposes of this chapter, any person injured thereby may obtain appropriate relief against the perpetrator of the fraud, including restitution from any person, other than a bona fide purchaser, benefiting from the fraud, whether innocent or not.  Any proceeding must be commenced within 2 years after the discovery of the fraud, but no proceeding may be brought against one not a perpetrator of the fraud later than 5 years after the time of commission of the fraud.  This section has no bearing on remedies relating to fraud practiced on a decedent during the decedent's lifetime which affects the succession of the decedent's estate.
