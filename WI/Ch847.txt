Action by settler on public lands.  A settler on the public lands of the United States, under the laws thereof may maintain an action to recover possession of the lands settled upon or claimed, or an action for injury to, or interference with such lands.

An action under this section, may not be brought if the land claimed exceeds 160 acres, located in one body or in different parcels, or if for 6 months next preceding the commencement of the action the plaintiff has not occupied or has neglected to cultivate the land claimed.

While no Wisconsin precedent specifically requires the original parties to be before the court, the presence of a party who has acquired intervening rights is ordinarily enough to defeat reformation.
