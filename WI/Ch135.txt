Two guideposts for determining the existence of a "community of interest" under sub.

Ziegler Co., Inc. v. Rexnord, Inc. 139 Wis. 2d 593, 407 N.W.2d 873 (1987).135.02 Annotation
A substantial investment distinguishes a dealership from a typical vendee-vendor relationship; establishing a loss of future profits is not sufficient.  Gunderjohn v. Loewen-America, Inc. 179 Wis. 2d 201, 507 N.W.2d 115 (Ct. App. 1993).135.02 Annotation

A dealership is a contract or agreement establishing a particular sort of commercial relationship that encompasses an extraordinary diverse set of business relationships not limited to the traditional franchise.  The focus of the analysis must be on whether the business relationship can be said to be situated in the state after examining a broad set of factors outlined by the court.  Baldewein Company v. Tri-Clover, Inc. 2000 WI 20, 233 Wis. 2d 57, 606 N.W.2d 145, 99-0541.  See also Baldewein Company v. Tri-Clover, Inc. 183 F. Supp. 2d 1116 (2002).135.02 Annotation
Assuming without deciding that the size of the local economy relative to the cost of the putative dealer's inventory of the grantor's products is a relevant factor in determining the existence of a community of interest, that factor did not demonstrate the existence of a community of interest in this case.  Moe v. Benelli U.S.A. Corp. 2007 WI App 254, 306 Wis. 2d 812, 743 N.W.2d 691, 06-1512.135.02 Annotation

A community of interest exists when a large proportion of a dealer's revenues are derived from the dealership, or when the alleged dealer has made sizable investments specialized in the grantor's goods or services.  Frieburg Farm Equip. v. Van Dale, Inc. 978 F.2d 395 (1992).135.02 Annotation
There is no "community of interest" in the sale of services not yet in existence when the availability of the services is dependent on the happening of an uncertain condition.  Simos v. Embassy Suites, Inc. 983 F.2d 1404 (1993).135.02 Annotation
This chapter does not protect a manufacturer's representative that lacks the unqualified authorization to sell or the authority to commit the manufacturer to a sale.  Sales & Marketing Assoc., Inc. v. Huffy Corp. 57 F.3d 602 (1995).135.02 Annotation
If a grantor is losing substantial money under the dealership relationship, it may constitute "good cause" for changes in the contract, including termination.  Morley-Murphy Co. v. Zenith Electronics, Inc. 142 F.3d 373 (1998).135.02 Annotation
This chapter specifies who may take advantage of its protections through the terms "dealer" and "dealership" and obviates the need to resort to conflict of laws principles.  Investment in the state without in-state sales does not bring a party within the coverage of the chapter.  Generac Corp. v. Caterpillar, Inc. 172 F.3d 971 (1999).135.02 Annotation
A manufacturer's right of approval of its distributors' subdistributors did not create a contractual relationship between the manufacturer and the subdistributor subject to this chapter.  Praefke Auto Electric & Battery Company, Inc. v. Tecumseh Products Company, Inc. 255 F.3d 460 (2001).135.02 Annotation

The employment relationship in question was not a "dealership."  O'Leary v. Sterling Extruder Corp. 533 F. Supp. 1205 (1982).135.02 Annotation
The plaintiff was not a "dealer" since money advanced to the company for fixtures and inventory was refundable.  Moore v. Tandy Corp. Radio Shack Div. 631 F. Supp. 1037 (1986).135.02 Annotation
It is improper to determine whether under sub. (3) a "community of interest" exists by examining the effect termination has on a division of the plaintiff.  U.S. v. Davis, 756 F. Supp. 1162 (1990).135.02 Annotation
The plaintiff's investment in "goodwill" was not sufficient to afford it protection under this chapter.  Team Electronics v. Apple Computer, 773 F. Supp. 153 (1991).135.02 Annotation
The "situated in this state" requirement under sub. (2) is satisfied as long as the dealership conducts business in Wisconsin.  CSS-Wisconsin Office v. Houston Satellite Systems, 779 F. Supp. 979 (1991). Down
