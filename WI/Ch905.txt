905.01 Annotation
This section precludes courts from recognizing common law privileges not contained in the statutes, or the U.S. or Wisconsin constitutions.  Privileges and confidentialities granted by statute are strictly interpreted.  Davison v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. 75 Wis. 2d 190, 248 N.W.2d 433 (1977).905.01 Annotation
A defendant did not have standing to complain that a physician's testimony violated the witness's physician-patient privilege under s. 905.04; the defendant was not authorized to claim the privilege on the patient's behalf.  State v. Echols, 152 Wis. 2d 725, 449 N.W.2d 320 (Ct. App. 1989).905.01 Annotation
As s. 907.06 (1) prevents a court from compelling an expert to testify, it logically follows that a litigant should not be able to so compel an expert and a privilege to refuse to testify is implied.  Burnett. v. Alt, 224 Wis. 2d 72, 589 N.W.2d 21 (1999), 96-3356.905.01 Annotation
Under Alt, a person asserting the privilege not to offer expert opinion testimony can be required to give that testimony only if: 1) there are compelling circumstances present; 2) there is a plan for reasonable compensation of the expert; and 3) the expert will not be required to do additional preparation for the testimony.  An exact question requiring expert opinion testimony and a clear assertion of the privilege are required for a court to decide whether compelling circumstances exist.  Alt does not apply to observations made by a person's treating physician relating to the care or treatment provided to the patient.  Glenn v. Plante, 2004 WI 24, 269 Wis. 2d 575, 676 N.W.2d 413, 02-1426.905.01 Annotation
The "inherent or implicit" language in this section is quite narrow in scope and was included by the supreme court to preserve a particular work product privilege already recognized at the time this language was added to the statute, while leaving other privileges to be provided for more expressly in other statutory provisions.  Sands v. The Whitnall School District, 2008 WI 89, 312 Wis. 2d 1, 754 N.W.2d 439, 05-1026.905.01 Annotation

Interpreters for persons with language difficulties, limited English proficiency, or hearing or speaking impairments. 905.015(1)(1)â€‚If an interpreter for a person with a language difficulty, limited English proficiency, as defined in s. 885.38 (1) (b), or a hearing or speaking impairment interprets as an aid to a communication which is privileged by statute, rules adopted by the supreme court, or the U.S. or state constitution, the interpreter may be prevented from disclosing the communication by any person who has a right to claim the privilege.  The interpreter may claim the privilege but only on behalf of the person who has the right.  The authority of the interpreter to do so is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
905.015(2)
(2)â€‚In addition to the privilege under sub. (1), a person who is licensed as an interpreter under s. 440.032 (3) may not disclose any aspect of a confidential communication facilitated by the interpreter unless one of the following conditions applies:
905.015(2)(a)
(a)  All parties to the confidential communication consent to the disclosure.
905.015(2)(b)
(b)  A court determines that the disclosure is necessary for the proper administration of justice.

905.02â€ƒ
Required reports privileged by statute.  A person, corporation, association, or other organization or entity, either public or private, making a return or report required by law to be made has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing the return or report, if provided by law.  A public officer or agency to whom a return or report is required by law to be made has a privilege to refuse to disclose the return or report if provided by law.  No privilege exists under this section in actions involving false swearing, fraudulent writing, fraud in the return or report, or other failure to comply with the law in question.

905.02 Annotation
This section applies only to privileges specifically and unequivocally provided by law against the disclosure of specific materials.  Davison v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. 75 Wis. 2d 190, 248 N.W.2d 433 (1977).905.03
