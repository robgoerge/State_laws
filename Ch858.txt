Personal representative files.  Except as provided by s. 865.11, the personal representative, within a reasonable time but no later than 6 months after appointment unless the court has by order extended or shortened the time, shall file an inventory of all property owned by the decedent.  The inventory when filed shall show, as of the date of the decedent's death, the value of all property, what property is marital property and the type and amount of any existing obligation relating to any item of property.  If a special administrator or personal representative has filed an inventory, no personal representative who is later appointed need file a further inventory unless additional property is found or the court orders otherwise.

Persons interested may be informed of inventory.  Not more than 5 days after filing an inventory with the court the personal representative shall mail or deliver to the surviving spouse and to all other persons interested, except those whose only interest is as a beneficiary of a monetary bequest or a bequest or devise of specific property, a statement indicating that the inventory has been filed and that a copy of the inventory, or a summary indicating the value of each item of property in which the person has an interest, will be sent to the person upon the person's written request to the personal representative.  If any person to whom the statement is required to be sent makes a request, the personal representative shall comply within 5 days after receipt of the request.  If a person interested to whom the statement is required to be sent is represented by a guardian of the estate or by a guardian ad litem, the statement shall be mailed or delivered to the guardian of the estate or the guardian ad litem but not to the person interested.  If the person interested is in the military service and is represented by an attorney or an attorney-in-fact, the statement shall be sent to both the attorney or the attorney-in-fact and the person interested.  Failure of the personal representative to comply with this section does not affect the jurisdiction of the court as to persons interested.
