706.01 History
History:  1971 c. 41; 1977 c. 253; 1983 a. 189, 455; 1993 a. 486; 1995 a. 227; 1999 a. 85; 2005 a. 41, 421; 2013 a. 1.706.01 Annotation
A necessary implication under sub. (3) is one that is so clear as to be express; it is a required implication.  The words "heirs and assigns," or any similar language, are unnecessary under sub. (3) to indicate a transferable interest.  As a matter of law, "Grantee" has the exact same meaning as "Grantee and his heirs and assigns" unless another meaning is expressly stated or implied.  Therefore, "heirs and assigns" need not be construed as having any legal effect and the use of the term in a grant of water flowage rights and not in a grant of sand removal rights in the same deed did not create a necessary implication that the sand rights were non-transferable.  Borek Cranberry Marsh v. Jackson County, 2010 WI 95, 328 Wis. 2d 613, 785 N.W.2d 615, 08-1144.706.02
