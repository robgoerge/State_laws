Recording of documents and public records by mechanical process authorized.  Whenever any officer of any county having a population of 500,000 or more is required or authorized by law to file, record, copy, recopy or replace any document, court order, plat, paper, written instrument, writings, record or book of record, on file or of record in his or her office, notwithstanding any other provisions in the statutes, the officer may do so by photostatic, photographic, microphotographic, microfilm, optical imaging, electronic formatting or other mechanical process which produces a clear, accurate and permanent copy or reproduction of the original document, court order, plat, paper, written instrument, writings, record or book of record in accordance with the standards specified under ss. 16.61 (7) and 16.612.  Any such officer may also reproduce by such processes or transfer from optical disk or electronic storage any document, court order, plat, paper, written instrument, writings, record or book of record which has previously been filed, recorded, copied or recopied.  Optical imaging or electronic formatting of any document is subject to authorization under s. 59.52 (14) (a).

Copy to be deemed to be original record. 228.03(1)
(1)â€‚A photographic reproduction of an original document, court order, plat, paper, written instrument, writing, record, book of record, file or other material, or a copy of material generated from optical disk or electronic storage of the original material, bearing upon or pertinent to the activities and functions of any county office, department, agency, board, commission, court or institution, in counties having a population of 500,000 or more, is deemed to be an original for all purposes, if it meets the applicable standards established in ss. 16.61 and 16.612.
228.03(2)
(2)â€‚Any photographic reproduction of an original record meeting the standards prescribed in s. 16.61 (7) or copy of a record generated from an original record stored in optical disk or electronic format in compliance with ss. 16.61 and 16.612 shall be taken as and stand in lieu of and have all of the effect of the original record and shall be admissible in evidence in all courts and all other tribunals or agencies, administrative or otherwise, in all cases where the original document is admissible.  A transcript, exemplification or certified copy of such a reproduction of an original record, or certified copy of a record generated from an original record stored in optical disk or electronic format, for the purposes specified in this subsection, is deemed to be a transcript, exemplification or certified copy of the original.

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the custodian shall permit all public records in his or her custody to be inspected, examined, abstracted or copied at reasonable times and under his or her supervision and regulation by any person; and the custodian shall, upon the demand of any person, furnish certified copies thereof on payment in advance of fees not to exceed the fees prescribed by law.
