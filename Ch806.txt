Ch. 806 Note
NOTE:  Chapter 806 was created by Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 714 (1975), which contains explanatory notes.  Statutes prior to the 1983-84 edition also contain these notes.
806.01
806.01â€ƒ
Judgment. 806.01(1)(1)â€‚ 806.01(1)(a)(a)  A judgment is the determination of the action.  It may be final or interlocutory.
806.01(1)(b)
(b)  Each judgment shall specify the relief granted or other determination of the action, and the name and place of residence of each party to the action.
806.01(1)(c)
(c)  Every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded the relief in the pleadings.  If there be no answer the relief granted to the plaintiff shall not exceed that demanded in the complaint.  If the amount of money sought was excluded from the demand for judgment, as required under s. 802.02 (1m), the court shall require the plaintiff to specify the amount of money claimed and provide that information to the court and to the other parties prior to the court rendering judgment.
806.01(2)
(2)â€‚If a partial judgment is proper in an action with several parties, the court in its discretion, may render judgment against one or more of the defendants and dismiss or permit the action to proceed against the others.  In case of a finding substantially disposing of a claim on its merits, but leaving an account to be taken or a condition to be performed in order fully to determine the rights of the parties, an interlocutory judgment may be rendered disposing of all issues covered by the finding and reserving final judgment.
806.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 715 (1975); 1975 c. 218; 1985 a. 145; 1987 a. 256.806.01 Annotation
An order filed after verdict that gave the plaintiff the option of accepting a reduced judgment or a new trial limited to the issue of damages was not a "judgment" under this section.  Collins v. Gee, 82 Wis. 2d 376, 263 N.W.2d 158 (1978).806.01 Annotation
Only the damages demanded may be awarded in a default judgment.  Because the complaint did not contain a specific damage claim in accordance with s. 802.02 (1m), the plaintiff's failure to serve an affidavit setting forth the amount of its claimed damages was grounds for reversing a default judgment.  Stein v. Illinois State Assistance Commission, 194 Wis. 2d 775, 535 N.W.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995).806.01 Annotation
While a written judgment clear on its face is not open to construction, the trial court has the authority to construe an ambiguous judgment to effectuate the trial court's objective.  A clarification is not a modification or amendment of the judgment.  Because the judge who drafted the ambiguous language has a superior practical knowledge of its meaning, when the judge resolves an ambiguity based on his or her experience of the trial and uses a reasonable rationale, an appellate court is to affirm the clarification.  Cashin v. Cashin, 2004 WI App 92, 273 Wis. 2d 754, 681 N.W.2d 255, 03-1010.806.01 Annotation
Use of a legal term of art is not necessary to incorporate documents.  Documents may be incorporated in an order or other legal document without being physically attached to the document.  Carney v. CNH Health & Welfare Plan, 2007 WI App 205, 305 Wis. 2d 443, 740 N.W.2d 625, 06-1529. Down
