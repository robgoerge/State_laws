Appeals as of right.  A final judgment or a final order of a circuit court may be appealed as a matter of right to the court of appeals unless otherwise expressly provided by law.  A final judgment or final order is a judgment, order or disposition that disposes of the entire matter in litigation as to one or more of the parties, whether rendered in an action or special proceeding, and that is one of the following:
808.03(1)(a)
(a)  Entered in accordance with s. 806.06 (1) (b) or 807.11 (2).
808.03(1)(b)
(b)  Recorded in docket entries in ch. 799 cases.
808.03(1)(c)
(c)  Recorded in docket entries in traffic regulation cases prosecuted in, or following a decision in a municipal court, appealed to, circuit court if a person convicted of a violation may be ordered to pay a forfeiture.

(d)  Recorded in docket entries in municipal ordinance violation cases prosecuted in, or following a decision in a municipal court, appealed to, circuit court.

(2)â€‚Appeals by permission.  A judgment or order not appealable as a matter of right under sub. (1) may be appealed to the court of appeals in advance of a final judgment or order upon leave granted by the court if it determines that an appeal will:
808.03(2)(a)
(a)  Materially advance the termination of the litigation or clarify further proceedings in the litigation;
808.03(2)(b)
(b)  Protect the petitioner from substantial or irreparable injury; or
808.03(2)(c)
(c)  Clarify an issue of general importance in the administration of justice.

(3)â€‚Review of an order denying suppression or exclusion of evidence. 808.03(3)(a)(a)  An order denying a motion to suppress evidence or a motion challenging the admissibility of a statement of a juvenile may be reviewed upon appeal from a final judgment or order notwithstanding the fact that the judgment or order was entered upon an admission or a plea of no contest to the allegations in the petition.
808.03(3)(b)
(b)  An order denying a motion to suppress evidence or a motion challenging the admissibility of a statement of a defendant may be reviewed upon appeal from a final judgment or order notwithstanding the fact that the judgment or order was entered upon a plea of guilty or no contest to the information or criminal complaint.
808.03 History
History:  1977 c. 187; 1979 c. 192; Sup. Ct. Order, 130 Wis. 2d xix (1986); 1995 a. 139, 224; 1997 a. 35; 2009 a. 27; 2015 a. 12.808.03 Cross-reference
Cross-reference:  See s. 767.217 (2) for appeals involving child support and maintenance.
808.03 Note
Judicial Council Note, 1979: Sub. (1) is amended to modify the statutory definition of the final judgment or final order that may be appealed as a matter of right to the court of appeals.  Most types of cases decided in circuit court have a final judgment or order entered with the office of clerk of court.  Because of the volume of traffic regulation and municipal ordinance violation cases prosecuted in circuit court, the prevailing custom in Wisconsin counties is to only record the dispositions of those cases in docket entries.  Requiring counties to meet the present statutory requirement in s. 808.03 (1) for the entry of a final judgment or order in all cases for purposes of having an appealable matter is unnecessarily burdensome and costly.  The term "traffic regulation cases" refers to only those traffic violation cases in which the penalty is a civil forfeiture.  [Bill 396-S]
Effective date note
Judicial Council Note, 1986: Sub. (1) is amended to clarify that docket entries in small claims and other ch. 799 cases may be final orders from which an appeal may be taken as of right.  See 1979 Judicial Council Note to sub. (1). [Re Order eff. 7-1-86]
