626.11â€ƒ
Rate standards. 626.11(1)(1)â€‚
General.  Rates determined under this chapter shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
626.11(2)
(2)â€‚Excessiveness.  Rates determined under this chapter are not excessive merely because a reasonable margin is allowed for a profit.
626.11(3)
(3)â€‚Adequacy.  The commissioner shall approve a minimum adequate pure premium for each classification under which worker's compensation insurance is written.  No insurer writing any insurance specified under s. 626.03 may use a pure premium less than that approved by the commissioner.
626.11 History
History:  1975 c. 148, 199.626.12
626.12â€ƒ
Rating methods.  In determining whether rates comply with the standards under s. 626.11, the following criteria shall be applied:
626.12(1)
(1)â€‚Basic factors in rates.  Due consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss and expense experience within and outside this state, to catastrophe hazards and contingencies, to a reasonable margin for profit, to dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, and to all other relevant factors.
626.12(2)
(2)â€‚Classification.  Risks may be classified in any reasonable way for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums.  Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both.  Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.
626.12(3)
(3)â€‚Physical impairment.  Rates or rating plans may not take into account the physical impairment of employees.  Any employer who applies or promotes any oppressive plan of physical examination and rejection of employees or applicants for employment shall forfeit the right to experience rating.  If the department of workforce development determines that grounds exist for such forfeiture it shall file with the commissioner a certified copy of its findings, which shall automatically suspend any experience rating credit for the employer.  The department shall make the determination as prescribed in ss. 103.005 (5) (b) to (f), (6) to (11), (13) (b) to (d) and (16), so far as such subsections are applicable, subject to review under ch. 227.  Restoration of an employer to the advantages of experience rating shall be by the same procedure.

Every such filing shall state its proposed effective date.  The bureau shall also file the information upon which it supports the filings.  All filings must comply with the law and shall not be effective nor used until approved by the commissioner.  A filing that has been on file for 30 days is deemed to meet the requirements of ss. 626.11 and 626.12 unless the commissioner earlier disapproves in a written order.

626.22(2)
(2)â€‚Timing of order.  The commissioner shall issue an order under s. 626.13 within 30 days after the filing and issue an order under sub. (1) within 30 days after the close of the hearing.

626.22(3)
(3)â€‚Interim rates.  Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result of an order by the commissioner under s. 626.13 or sub.

When new rates become legally effective, the commissioner shall order the escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be distributed appropriately, except that refunds that are trifling shall not be required.
