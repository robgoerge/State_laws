Any person who pretends to purchase property to be transported by such person or who purchases property immediately prior to and sells it immediately after the transportation thereof shall be deemed to be transporting the property for hire and not a bona fide purchaser or seller thereof.  The rental of a motor vehicle to a person for transportation of the person's property which rental directly or indirectly includes the services of a driver shall be deemed to be transportation for hire and not private carriage.

A buy-sell arrangement whereby the carrier "buys" property at the shipping point, immediately transports it to a delivery point, and there "sells" it to the real purchaser â€” with the carrier's profit amounting only to the price of the transportation between the 2 points â€” raises a rebuttable presumption under sub. (15) [now sub. (4)], that the property is being transported "for hire."  Gensler v. Dept. of Revenue, 70 Wis. 2d 1108, 236 N.W.2d 648 (1975).194.02

Legislative intent.  It is the intent of the legislature to remove the economic regulations which limit motor carrier operations in the state.
