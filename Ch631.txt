Application of statutes. 631.01(1)
(1)â€‚
General.  This chapter and ch. 632 apply to all insurance policies and group certificates delivered or issued for delivery in this state, on property ordinarily located in this state, on persons residing in this state when the policy or group certificate is issued, or on business operations in this state, except:
631.01(1)(a)
(a)  As provided in ss. 600.01 and 618.42;
631.01(1)(b)
(b)  On business operations in this state if the contract is negotiated outside this state and if the operations in this state are incidental or subordinate to operations outside this state, unless the contract is for a policy of insurance to cover a warranty, as defined in s. 100.205 (1) (g), in which case the provisions set forth in sub. (4m) apply; and
631.01(1)(c)
(c)  As otherwise provided in the statutes.
631.01(2)
(2)â€‚Reinsurance. Sections 631.05, 631.15 (1), 631.41, 631.45 and 631.81 apply to contracts used in reinsurance; the commissioner may specify by rule that reinsurance contracts are subject to other provisions of this chapter and ch. 632 upon a finding that the interests of Wisconsin insureds, of ceding insurers domiciled in this state or of the public in this state so require.
631.01(3)
