96.01 History
History:  1977 c. 29 s. 1650m (2); 1981 c. 283, 314; 2005 a. 441; 2009 a. 401; 2011 a. 32.96.02
96.02â€ƒ
Policy.  It is declared to be the policy of this state to promote orderly and efficient marketing of agricultural commodities and to prevent economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this state.  Unfair methods of competition, lack of uniform grading and classification of agricultural commodities, and the inability of individual producers to obtain present markets or to develop new or larger markets for Wisconsin agricultural commodities result in disorderly marketing of such commodities.  As a result agricultural producers are prevented from receiving a fair return for the products which they market.  Such conditions jeopardize the continued production of adequate food and energy supplies for this and other states, and may result in unemployment with its attendant burdens on the citizens of this state.  The production, processing and marketing of agricultural commodities within this state is hereby declared to be affected with a public interest and this chapter is enacted for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety and general welfare of the people of this state.
