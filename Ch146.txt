Any hospital employee who provides health care, social worker, or intake worker under ch. 48 may refer an infant or an expectant mother of an unborn child, as defined in s. 48.02 (19), to a physician for testing of the bodily fluids of the infant or expectant mother for controlled substances or controlled substance analogs if the hospital employee who provides health care, social worker, or intake worker suspects that the infant or expectant mother has controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in the bodily fluids of the infant or expectant mother because of the use of controlled substances or controlled substance analogs by the mother while she was pregnant with the infant or by the expectant mother while she is pregnant with the unborn child.  The physician may test the infant or expectant mother to ascertain whether or not the infant or expectant mother has controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in the bodily fluids of the infant or expectant mother, if the physician determines that there is a serious risk that there are controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in the bodily fluids of the infant or expectant mother because of the use of controlled substances or controlled substance analogs by the mother while she was pregnant with the infant or by the expectant mother while she is pregnant with the unborn child and that the health of the infant, the unborn child or the child when born may be adversely affected by the controlled substances or controlled substance analogs.  If the results of the test indicate that the infant does have controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in the infant's bodily fluids, the physician shall report the occurrence of that condition in the infant to the agency, as defined in s. 48.981 (1) (ag), that is responsible for conducting child abuse and neglect investigations under s. 48.981, and that agency shall offer to provide, or arrange or refer for the provision of, services and treatment for the child and the child's mother as provided under s. 46.238.
