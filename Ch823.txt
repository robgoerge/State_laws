823.01â€ƒ
Jurisdiction over nuisances.  Any person, county, city, village or town may maintain an action to recover damages or to abate a public nuisance from which injuries peculiar to the complainant are suffered, so far as necessary to protect the complainant's rights and to obtain an injunction to prevent the same.
823.01 History
History:  1973 c. 189; Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 762 (1975); Stats. 1975 s. 823.01.
823.01 Annotation
A town's recovery under nuisance statutes does not require injury to the town's own property.  Town of East Troy v. Soo Line Railroad Co. 653 F.2d 1123 (1980).823.01 Annotation

823.015
823.015â€ƒ
Action against condominium association.  If a city, village, town, or county has grounds under this chapter to abate a nuisance occurring upon the common elements of a condominium and the failure of a condominium association under ch. 703 to perform its duties to maintain and control the common elements is a reason the nuisance has not been abated, an action for a receivership under ch. 823 may be brought against the condominium association whether it is incorporated or unincorporated.  This section does not authorize the seizure of condominium buildings or units.
823.015 History
History:  2003 a. 283.823.015 Note
NOTE:  2003 Wis. Act 283, which affected this section, contains extensive explanatory notes.
823.02
823.02â€ƒ
Injunction against public nuisance, time extension.  An action to enjoin a public nuisance may be commenced and prosecuted in the name of the state, either by the attorney general on information obtained by the department of justice, or upon the relation of a private individual, sewerage commission created under ss. 200.01 to 200.15 or a county, having first obtained leave therefor from the court.  An action to enjoin a public nuisance may be commenced and prosecuted by a city, village, town or a metropolitan sewerage district created under ss. 200.21 to 200.65 in the name of the municipality or metropolitan sewerage district, and it is not necessary to obtain leave from the court to commence or prosecute the action.  The same rule as to liability for costs shall govern as in other actions brought by the state.  No stay of any order or judgment enjoining or abating, in any action under this section, may be had unless the appeal is taken within 5 days after notice of entry of the judgment or order or service of the injunction.  Upon appeal and stay, the return to the court of appeals or supreme court shall be made immediately.
823.02 History
History:  1971 c. 276; Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 762 (1975); Stats. 1975 s. 823.02; 1977 c. 187, 379; 1981 c. 282; 1999 a. 150 s. 672.823.02 Annotation
This section was not repealed by implication by the creation of former ss. 144.30 to 144.46 [now see chs. 285 and 289] that empower DNR to investigate sources of pollution.  State v. Dairyland Power Coop. 52 Wis. 2d 45, 187 N.W.2d 878 (1971).823.02 Annotation
A court of equity will not enjoin a crime or ordinance violation to enforce the law, but will if the violation constitutes a nuisance.  Repeated violations of an ordinance constitute a public nuisance as a matter of law, and the injunction can only enjoin operations that constitute violations of the ordinance.  State v. H. Samuels Co. 60 Wis. 2d 631, 211 N.W.2d 417 (1973).823.02 Annotation
The concept that an owner of real property can, in all cases, do with the property as he or she pleases is no longer in harmony with the realities of society.  The "reasonable use" rule applies.  State v. Deetz, 66 Wis. 2d 1, 224 N.W.2d 407 (1974).823.02 Annotation
A nuisance is an unreasonable activity or use of property that interferes substantially with the comfortable enjoyment of life, health, or safety of others.  State v. Quality Egg Farm, Inc. 104 Wis. 2d 506, 311 N.W.2d 650 (1981).823.02 Annotation
Prohibiting injunctive relief against a person merely because the person was acting independently would render a public nuisance that consisted of multiple independent actors engaging in acts of prostitution immune to effective redress.  Accordingly, a trial court had authority to issue an injunction to abate the individual's role in prostitution that undisputed evidence proved was a public nuisance.  City of Milwaukee v. Burnette, 2001 WI App 258, 248 Wis. 2d 820, 637 N.W.2d 447, 00-2308.823.02 Annotation

823.04â€ƒ

823.06â€ƒ
Expense of abating, how collected.
