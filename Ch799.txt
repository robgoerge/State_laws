799.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 776 (1975); 1975 c. 325, 365, 422; 1977 c. 449 s. 497; 1979 c. 32 ss. 66, 92 (16); 1979 c. 175 s. 53; Stats. 1979 s. 799.01; 1983 a. 228; 1987 a. 208, 378, 403; 1989 a. 31, 359; 1991 a. 163; 1993 a. 80, 181; 1995 a. 27; 2011 a. 32.799.01 Annotation
This section does not authorize the court to grant injunctional relief.  County of Columbia v. Bylewski, 94 Wis. 2d 153, 288 N.W.2d 129 (1980).799.01 Annotation
The $5,000 small claims limitation applies to pecuniary loss, but not to costs and fees associated with the loss.  Reusch v. Roob, 2000 WI App 76, 234 Wis. 2d 270, 610 N.W.2d 168, 98-3102.799.01 Annotation
A plaintiff may elect to sue in small claims court when actual damages exceed $5,000.  The small claims award limitation is a limit on recovery, not a bar that denies the court jurisdiction over cases in which the plaintiff's actual damages exceed $5,000.  When a trial court finds that a small claims plaintiff's actual damages exceed the statutory award limit of $5,000, the court should apply any reduction for comparative negligence to the damages found before applying the statutory limit.  Bryhan v. Pink, 2006 WI App 110, 294 Wis. 2d 347, 718 N.W.2d 112, 05-1030. Down
