Initial appearance before a judge. 970.01(1)
(1)â€‚Any person who is arrested shall be taken within a reasonable time before a judge in the county in which the offense was alleged to have been committed.  The initial appearance may be conducted on the record by telephone or live audiovisual means under s. 967.08.  If the initial appearance is conducted by telephone or live audiovisual means, the person may waive physical appearance.  Waiver of physical appearance shall be placed on the record of the initial appearance and does not waive other grounds for challenging the court's personal jurisdiction.  If the person does not waive physical appearance, conducting the initial appearance by telephone or live audiovisual means under s. 967.08 does not waive any grounds that the person has for challenging the court's personal jurisdiction.
970.01(2)
(2)â€‚When a person is arrested without a warrant and brought before a judge, a complaint shall be filed forthwith.
970.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 141 Wis. 2d xiii (1987); 1987 a. 403; 1995 a. 27.970.01 Note
Judicial Council Note, 1988: Sub. (1) is amended to authorize the arrested person to waive physical appearance and request that the initial appearance be conducted on the record by telephone or live audio-visual means. [Re Order effective Jan. 1, 1988]
970.01 Annotation
The interval between an arrest and an initial appearance is never unreasonable when the arrested suspect is already in the lawful physical custody of the state.  State v. Harris, 174 Wis. 2d 367, 497 N.W.2d 742 (Ct. App. 1993).970.01 Annotation
The rule that a judicial determination of probable cause must be made within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest applies to Wisconsin; failure to comply did not require suppression of evidence not obtained because of the delay when probable cause for arrest was present.  State v. Koch, 175 Wis. 2d 684, 499 N.W.2d 153 (1993).970.01 Annotation
Failure to conduct a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest is not a jurisdictional defect and not grounds for dismissal with prejudice or voiding of a subsequent conviction unless the delay prejudiced the defendant's right to present a defense. State v. Golden, 185 Wis. 2d 763, 519 N.W.2d 659 (Ct. App. 1994).970.01 Annotation
A person taken into custody on a probation hold while an investigation is made to determine if a probation violation has occurred is not under arrest and not subject to the requirement of a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest.  State v. Martinez, 198 Wis. 2d 222, 542 N.W.2d 215 (Ct. App. 1995), 94-3006.970.01 Annotation
A determination of probable cause made within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest generally meets the promptness requirement; if a hearing is held more than 48 hours following an arrest the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate an emergency or extraordinary circumstances.  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 114 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1991).970.02

970.03â€ƒ
Preliminary examination. 970.03(1)
(1)â€‚A preliminary examination is a hearing before a court for the purpose of determining if there is probable cause to believe a felony has been committed by the defendant.  A preliminary examination may be held in conjunction with a bail revocation hearing under s. 969.08 (5) (b), but separate findings shall be made by the judge relating to the preliminary examination and to the bail revocation.
970.03(2)
(2)â€‚The preliminary examination shall be commenced within 20 days after the initial appearance of the defendant if the defendant has been released from custody or within 10 days if the defendant is in custody and bail has been fixed in excess of $500.  On stipulation of the parties or on motion and for cause, the court may extend such time.
970.03(3)
(3)â€‚A plea shall not be accepted in any case in which a preliminary examination is required until the defendant has been bound over following preliminary examination or waiver thereof.
970.03(4)
(4)â€‚970.03(4)(a)(a)  If the defendant is accused of a crime under s. 940.225, 948.02, 948.025, 948.05, 948.051, 948.06, 948.085, or 948.095, or under s. 940.302 (2), if the court finds that the crime was sexually motivated, as defined in s. 980.01 (5), the court may exclude from the hearing all persons who are not officers of the court, members of the complainant's or defendant's families or others considered by the court to be supportive of the complainant or defendant, the service representative, as defined in s. 895.45 (1) (c), or other persons required to attend, if the court finds that the state or the defendant has established a compelling interest that would likely be prejudiced if the persons were not excluded.  The court may consider as a compelling interest, among others, the need to protect a complainant from undue embarrassment and emotional trauma.
970.03(4)(b)
(b)  In making its order under this subsection, the court shall set forth specific findings sufficient to support the closure order.  In making these findings, the court shall consider, and give substantial weight to, the desires, if any, of the complainant.  Additional factors that the court may consider in making these findings include, but are not limited to, the complainant's age, psychological maturity and understanding; the nature of the crime; and the desires of the complainant's family.
970.03(4)(c)
(c)  The court shall make its closure order under this subsection no broader than is necessary to protect the compelling interest under par. (a) and shall consider any reasonable alternatives to full closure of the entire hearing.
970.03(5)
(5)â€‚All witnesses shall be sworn and their testimony reported by a phonographic reporter.  The defendant may cross-examine witnesses against the defendant, and may call witnesses on the defendant's own behalf who then are subject to cross-examination.
970.03(6)
(6)â€‚During the preliminary examination, the court may exclude witnesses until they are called to testify, may direct that persons who are expected to be called as witnesses be kept separate until called and may prevent them from communicating with one another until they have been examined.
970.03(7)
(7)â€‚If the court finds probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed by the defendant, it shall bind the defendant over for trial.
970.03(8)
(8)â€‚If the court finds that it is probable that only a misdemeanor has been committed by the defendant, it shall amend the complaint to conform to the evidence.  The action shall then proceed as though it had originated as a misdemeanor action.
970.03(9)
(9)â€‚If the court does not find probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the defendant, it shall order the defendant discharged forthwith.
970.03(10)
(10)â€‚In multiple count complaints, the court shall order dismissed any count for which it finds there is no probable cause.  The facts arising out of any count ordered dismissed shall not be the basis for a count in any information filed pursuant to ch. 971.  Section 970.04 shall apply to any dismissed count.
