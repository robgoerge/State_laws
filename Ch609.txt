609.001â€ƒ
Joint ventures; legislative findings. 609.001(1)
(1)â€‚The legislature finds that increased development of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider plans and limited service health organizations may have the effect of putting small, independent health care providers at a competitive disadvantage with larger health care providers.  In order to avoid monopolistic situations and to provide competitive alternatives, it may be necessary for those small, independent health care providers to form joint ventures.  The legislature finds that these joint ventures are a desirable means of health care cost containment to the extent that they increase the number of entities with which a health maintenance organization, preferred provider plan or limited service health organization may choose to contract and to the extent that the joint ventures do not violate state or federal antitrust laws.
609.001(2)
(2)â€‚The legislature finds that competition in the health care market will be enhanced by allowing employers and organizations which otherwise act independently to join together in a manner consistent with the state and federal antitrust laws for the purpose of purchasing health care coverage for employees and members.  These joint ventures will allow purchasers of health care coverage to obtain volume discounts when they negotiate with insurers and health care providers.  These joint ventures should result in an improved business climate in this state because of reduced costs for health care coverage.
