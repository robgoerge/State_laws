788.01
788.01â€ƒ
Arbitration clauses in contracts enforceable.  A provision in any written contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of the contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part of the contract, or an agreement in writing between 2 or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to submit, shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.  This chapter shall not apply to contracts between employers and employees, or between employers and associations of employees, except as provided in s. 111.10, nor to agreements to arbitrate disputes under s. 292.63 (6s) or 230.44 (4) (bm).
788.01 History
History:  1979 c. 32 s. 64; Stats. 1979 s. 788.01; 1993 a. 16; 1997 a. 237, 254; 2001 a. 38; 2013 a. 20.788.01 Annotation
An insurer's refusal to either pay the plaintiff's claim under the uninsured motorist provision of its automobile policy or to submit to arbitration under an arbitration clause that could be invoked by either party constituted a breach of the contract and a waiver of the insurer's right to later demand arbitration.  Collicott v. Economy Fire and Casualty Co. 68 Wis. 2d 115, 227 N.W.2d 668 (1975).788.01 Annotation
Failure to comply with provisions of ch. 298 [now ch. 788] constitutes waiver of the contractual right to arbitration.  State ex rel. Carl v. Charles, 71 Wis. 2d 85, 237 N.W.2d 29 (1976).788.01 Annotation
If the intent of the parties is not clearly expressed, the court favors construing an arbitration agreement as statutory rather than common law arbitration.  Stradinger v. City of Whitewater, 89 Wis. 2d 19, 277 N.W.2d 827 (1979).788.01 Annotation
Although courts have common law jurisdiction to enforce arbitration awards generally, they cannot enforce an award against the state absent express legislative authorization.  State ex rel. Teaching Assistants Associates v. UW-Madison 96 Wis. 2d 492, 292 N.W.2d 657 (Ct. App. 1980).  But see also the note to State v. P.G. Miron Const. Co.
788.01 Annotation
Municipal labor arbitration is within the scope of ch. 788.  Milwaukee District Council 48 v. Milwaukee Sewerage Commission, 107 Wis. 2d 590, 321 N.W.2d 309 (Ct. App. 1982).
788.01 Annotation
Insurance coverage is a proper matter for arbitration.  Maryland Casualty Co. v. Seidenspinner, 181 Wis. 2d 950, 512 N.W.2d 186 (Ct. App. 1994).788.01 Annotation
Sovereign immunity is not applicable to arbitration and there need not be specific statutory authority for the state to be subject to the arbitration provisions of ch. 788.  State v. P.G. Miron Construction Co. 181 Wis. 2d 1045, 512 N.W.2d 499 (1994).788.01 Annotation
Preclusion doctrines preventing rehearing of identical claims are applicable to a limited extent in arbitration cases.  Dane County v. Dane County Union Local 65, 210 Wis. 2d 267, 565 N.W.2d 540 (Ct. App.1997), 96-0359.788.01 Annotation
Whether the parties agreed to submit an issue to arbitration is a question of law for the courts to decide.  Kimberly Area School District v. Zdanovec, 222 Wis. 2d 27, 586 N.W.2d 41 (Ct. App. 1998), 98-0783.788.01 Annotation
The trial court erred in ruling that the unavailability of the arbitrator named in an agreement resulted in a dissolution of the agreement's arbitration provision.  When the primary purpose of the dispute resolution provision in the agreement is to arbitrate disputes that arise between the parties, the unavailability of the named arbitrator does not nullify an arbitration provision.  Madison Teachers, Inc. v. Wisconsin Education Association Council, 2005 WI App 180, 285 Wis. 2d 737, 703 N.W.2d 711, 04-1053.788.01 Annotation
The designation of a specific arbitration service and the incorporation of its rules governing all aspects of arbitration was integral to the parties' alternate dispute resolution (ADR) agreement to a degree as integral as the agreement to arbitrate itself. In light of a consent judgment effectively barring the arbitration service from arbitration, the ADR agreement failed altogether.  Riley v. Extendicare Health Facilities, Inc. 2013 WI App 9, 345 Wis. 2d 804, 826 N.W.2d 398, 12-0311.788.01 Annotation
Commercial arbitration agreements: let the signers beware.  61 MLR 466.
788.015
788.015â€ƒ
Agreement to arbitrate real estate transaction disputes.  A provision in any written agreement between a purchaser or seller of real estate and a real estate broker, or between a purchaser and seller of real estate, to submit to arbitration any controversy between them arising out of the real estate transaction is valid, irrevocable and enforceable except upon any grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any agreement.  The agreement may limit the types of controversies required to be arbitrated and specify a term during which the parties agree to be bound by the agreement.
788.015 History
History:  1991 a. 163.788.02
788.02â€ƒ
Stay of action to permit arbitration.  If any suit or proceeding be brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.
788.02 History
History:  1979 c. 32 s. 64; Stats. 1979 s. 788.02.788.02 Annotation
Commencing litigation did not waive a contractual right to arbitration.  J.J. Andrews, Inc. v. Midland, 164 Wis. 2d 215, 474 N.W.2d 756 (Ct. App. 1991).788.02 Annotation
The right to arbitrate may be waived.  Conduct that allows an action to proceed to a point where the purpose of arbitration is frustrated estops a party from claiming a right to arbitration.  Meyer v. Classified Ins. Corp. 179 Wis. 2d 386, 507 N.W.2d 149 (Ct. App. 1993).
788.03
788.03â€ƒ
Court order to arbitrate; procedure.  The party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect or refusal of another to perform under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any court of record having jurisdiction of the parties or of the property for an order directing that such arbitration proceed as provided for in such agreement.  Five days' notice in writing of such application shall be served upon the party in default.  Service thereof shall be made as provided by law for the service of a summons.  The court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  If the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect or refusal to perform the same is in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.  If no jury trial is demanded, the court shall hear and determine such issue.  Where such an issue is raised, either party may, on or before the return day of the notice of application, demand a jury trial of such issue, and upon such demand the court shall make an order referring the issue to a jury summoned and selected under s. 756.06.  If the jury finds that no agreement in writing for arbitration was made or that there is no default in proceeding thereunder, the proceeding shall be dismissed.  If the jury finds that an agreement for arbitration was made in writing and that there is a default in proceeding thereunder, the court shall make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.
788.03 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 775 (1975); 1977 c. 187 s. 135; 1979 c. 32 s. 64; Stats. 1979 s. 788.03; Sup. Ct. Order No. 96-08, 207 Wis. 2d xv (1997).788.03 Annotation
An insured who acceded to the insurer's refusal to arbitrate the insured's uninsured motorist claim until after the insured's passengers' claims were litigated was not an "aggrieved party" within the meaning of this section.  Worthington v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 77 Wis. 2d 508, 253 N.W.2d 76 (1977).788.03 Annotation
In the absence of a reservation of rights, "partial participation" in the arbitration process may estop a party from challenging an arbitration agreement.  Pilgrim Investment Corp. v. Reed, 156 Wis. 2d 677, 457 N.W.2d 544 (Ct. App. 1990).788.03 Annotation
This section is only available when an underlying lawsuit has not yet been filed.  When a lawsuit has been commenced, a party may not use the special procedure outlined in this section to compel arbitration.  The party may still seek an order to arbitrate, but it must do so in the court where the underlying lawsuit is pending, not by initiating a separate action.  The Payday Loan Store of Wisconsin Inc. v. Krueger, 2013 WI App 25, 346 Wis. 2d 237, 828 N.W.2d 587, 12-0751.788.03 Annotation
Timeliness and estoppel defenses against arbitration are to be determined in the arbitration proceedings, not by a court in a proceeding under this section to compel arbitration.  This conclusion in this case was based on Wisconsin's public policy favoring arbitration, the arbitration agreement in this case, the Realtors Association's arbitration procedures, the limited role of courts in actions to compel arbitration under this section, and relevant case law.  First Weber Group, Inc. v. Synergy Real Estate Group, LLC, 2015 WI 34, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ N.W.2d ___, 13-1205.788.03 Annotation
The legislature has determined that the courts have a limited role in the context of arbitration.  In an action to compel arbitration under this section, the issues are limited to the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform under the agreement.  When determining whether a dispute is arbitrable, a court's function is limited to a determination of whether there is a construction of the arbitration clause that would cover the grievance on its face and whether any other provision of the contract specifically excludes it.  First Weber Group, Inc. v. Synergy Real Estate Group, LLC, 2015 WI 34, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ N.W.2d ___, 13-1205.788.04

Arbitrators, how chosen. 788.04(1)
(1)â€‚If, in the agreement, provision is made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire that method shall be followed.  If no method is provided in the agreement, or if a method is provided and any party thereto fails to make use of the method, or if for any other reason there is a lapse in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, or in filling a vacancy, then upon the application of either party to the controversy, the court specified in s. 788.02 or the circuit court for the county in which the arbitration is to be held shall designate and appoint an arbitrator, arbitrators or umpire, as the case or sub. (2) may require, who shall act under the agreement with the same force and effect as if specifically named in the agreement; and, except as provided in sub. (2) or unless otherwise provided in the agreement, the arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator.
788.04(2)
(2)â€‚A panel of arbitrators, consisting of 3 persons shall be appointed to arbitrate actions to recover damages for injuries to the person arising from any treatment or operation performed by or any omission by any person who is required to be licensed, registered or certified to treat the sick as defined in s. 448.01 (10).
788.04(2)(a)
(a)  One arbitrator shall be appointed by the court from a list of attorneys with trial experience.  The list shall be prepared and periodically revised by the State Bar of Wisconsin.
788.04(2)(b)
(b)  One arbitrator shall be appointed by the court from lists of health professionals prepared and periodically revised by the appropriate statewide organizations of health professionals.  The lists shall designate the specialty, if any, of each health professional listed.  The organizations of health professionals shall assist the court to determine the appropriate specialty of the arbitrator for each action to be arbitrated.
788.04(2)(c)
(c)  One arbitrator who is not an attorney or a health professional shall be appointed by the court.
788.04(2)(d)
(d)  Any person appointed to the arbitration panel may disqualify himself or herself or be disqualified by the court if any reason exists which requires disqualification.  A substitute member of the arbitration panel shall be chosen in the same manner as the person disqualified was chosen.
788.04(2)(e)
(e)  No member of the panel may participate in any subsequent court proceeding on the action arbitrated as either a counsel or a witness unless the court deems the member's testimony necessary for hearings under s. 788.10 or 788.11.
