Mandatory plans. 619.01(1)(a)(a) 
Establishment of plans.  If the commissioner finds after a hearing that in any part of this state automobile insurance, property insurance, health care liability insurance, liability insurance but not to include coverage for risks that are determined to be uninsurable, worker's compensation insurance, insurance coverage for foster homes, or insurance coverage for group homes is not readily available in the voluntary market, and that the public interest requires that availability, the commissioner may by rule either promulgate plans to provide such insurance coverages for any risks in this state that are equitably entitled to, but otherwise unable to obtain, that coverage, or may call upon the insurance industry to prepare plans for the commissioner's approval.
619.01(1)(b)
(b) 
Purposes and contents of risk-sharing plans.  The plan promulgated or prepared under par. (a) shall:
619.01(1)(b)1.
1.  Give consideration to the need for adequate and readily accessible coverage, to alternative methods of improving the market affected, to the preferences of the insurers and agents, to the inherent limitations of the insurance mechanism, to the need for reasonable underwriting standards, and to the requirement of reasonable loss prevention measures;
619.01(1)(b)2.
2.  Establish procedures that will create minimum interference with the voluntary market;
619.01(1)(b)3.
3.  Spread the burden imposed by the facility equitably and efficiently within the industry; and
619.01(1)(b)4.
4.  Establish procedures for applicants and participants to have grievances reviewed by an impartial body.

619.01(1)(c)2.
2.  Each health care liability insurance plan shall require participation by all insurers insuring persons in this state against liability resulting from personal injuries.  Any deficit in a health care liability insurance plan in any year shall be recouped by actuarially sound rate increases which take into account any plan surplus and are applicable prospectively.  Each plan shall maintain a surplus determined by the commissioner acting under ss. 623.11 and 623.12.
619.01(1)(c)3.
3.  No county, town, village or city shall be required to participate in any municipal liability risk-sharing plan promulgated or approved by the commissioner under this section or be assessed for the cost of any such plan in which it is not participating.
619.01(1)(c)4.
4.  A foster home protection insurance plan shall require participation by all insurers insuring persons in this state under policies described in subchs. I or III of ch. 632 and all agents licensed to represent such insurers in this state except that the commissioner may exclude classes of persons for administrative convenience or because it is not equitable or practicable to require them to participate in the plan.
