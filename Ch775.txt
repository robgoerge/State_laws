Actions against state; bond.  Upon the refusal of the legislature to allow a claim against the state the claimant may commence an action against the state by service as provided in s. 801.11 (3) and by filing with the clerk of court a bond, not exceeding $1,000, with 2 or more sureties, to be approved by the attorney general, to the effect that the claimant will indemnify the state against all costs that may accrue in such action and pay to the clerk of court all costs, in case the claimant fails to obtain judgment against the state.
775.01 History
History:  Sup. Ct. Order, 67 Wis. 2d 585, 775 (1975); 1975 c. 218; 1979 c. 32 s. 53; Stats. 1979 s. 775.01.775.01 Annotation
The bond requirement of s. 775.01 may be waived under s. 814.29 (1).  Boldt v. State, 101 Wis. 2d 566, 305 N.W.2d 133 (1981).775.01 Annotation
Legislative adjournment before action on a bill authorizing payment of a claim constitutes refusal of the claim and satisfies the condition precedent for commencing an action.  Cross-claimants are also required to meet the statutory conditions precedent.  This section allows actions on a debt but does not allow tort actions or actions based on equity, including actions for unjust enrichment.  CleanSoils Wisconsin, Inc. v. DOT, 229 Wis. 2d 600, 599 N.W.2d 903 (Ct. App. 1999), 98-3374.775.01 Annotation
A claim subject to this section must be presented to the legislature, in the form of a bill, and rejected before suit may be filed on the claim.  The procedure is not optional.  Brown v. State, 230 Wis. 2d 355, 602 N.W.2d 79 (Ct. App. 1999), 98-2662.775.01 Annotation
A breach of contract claim seeking damages for lost profits and expenses incurred is not a claim within the meaning of this section.  The relevant inquiry here is whether the breach of contract claim is an action of debt or indebitatus assumpsit.  "Debt," for which an action of debt will lie, is a specific sum of money that is due or owing from one to another.  Koshick v. State, 2005 WI App 232, 287 Wis. 2d 608, 706 N.W.2d 174, 05-0539.775.04
775.04â€ƒ
Judgment, how paid.  No execution shall issue against the state on any judgment, but whenever a final judgment against the state shall have been obtained in any such action the clerk shall make and furnish to the department of administration a duly certified transcript of such judgment; and the department of administration shall thereupon audit the amount of damages and costs therein awarded, and the same shall be paid out of the state treasury.

(4)â€‚If the claims board finds that the petitioner was innocent and that he or she did not by his or her act or failure to act contribute to bring about the conviction and imprisonment for which he or she seeks compensation, the claims board shall find the amount which will equitably compensate the petitioner, not to exceed $25,000 and at a rate of compensation not greater than $5,000 per year for the imprisonment.  Compensation awarded by the claims board shall include any amount to which the board finds the petitioner is entitled for attorney fees, costs and disbursements.  If the claims board finds that the amount it is able to award is not an adequate compensation it shall submit a report specifying an amount which it considers adequate to the chief clerk of each house of the legislature, for distribution to the legislature under s. 13.172 (2).
775.05(5)

When there was no evidence in support of the claimant's conviction, and he was innocent as a matter of law, the Claims Board's finding to the contrary was inexplicable.  Turnpaugh v. State of Wisconsin Claims Board, 2012 WI App 72, 342 Wis. 2d 182, 816 N.W.2d 920, 11-2365.775.05 Annotation

775.06(5)
(5)â€‚If from its findings of fact the claims board concludes that the petitioner was in line of duty as a law enforcement officer of the state and acted in good faith at the time of the transaction in question, the claims board shall award and certify to the petitioner the amount of the judgment which the petitioner must pay; if the claims board further finds that the counsel fees and costs claimed by the petitioner are reasonable and that the contract of employment was in accordance with law and was not made with any other state officer, employee, or agent, the claims board shall further award and certify to the petitioner the amount of said counsel fees and costs; the entire award shall be from the appropriation made by s. 20.505 (4) (d), but not to exceed $5,000.
