The personal representative may make one or more partial distributions of the estate, provided that other distributees and claimants are not prejudiced thereby.  The personal representative may require the distributees to give security for the return of such property.

Assignment by distributee.  If any person interested in an estate assigns all or part of his or her interest in the estate, other than an interest not assignable by the specific language of the will, as collateral or otherwise and the assignee serves a copy of the assignment on the personal representative of the estate and files a copy with the court in which the estate is being administered before the entry of the final judgment and before the property or interest covered by the assignment has been distributed under s. 863.01, the court shall assign to the assignee in the final judgment the interest or part of the interest of the assignor included within the assignment to the extent that the assignment is valid as determined by the court, after giving effect to any credits to which the assignor may prove himself or herself entitled.  A personal representative incurs no liability to an assignee of a person interested for any acts performed or distribution made by the personal representative prior to the time a copy of the assignment is received by the personal representative or he or she has actual knowledge of the assignment.

Value used in distribution of fractional shares.  In distributing property to distributees who receive fractional shares of the estate under the statutes of descent and distribution or under provisions in a will, the personal representative shall divide the property among the distributees on the basis of the value of the property at the time of distribution unless the will provides otherwise.
863.17
863.17â€ƒ
Partition by agreement.  Property passing to persons as joint tenants or tenants in common may be partitioned among those persons by the judgment of the court assigning the property, if a petition therefor signed by all persons interested in the property involved is filed with the court prior to the judgment.  The petition must set out the manner in which the property is to be divided and the agreement of all persons interested in the property involved.

863.19â€ƒ
Valuation used in distribution of estate assets.  If a general bequest of estate assets, including a pecuniary bequest, in a dollar amount fixed by formula or otherwise is satisfied by a distribution in kind, the distribution shall be made at current fair market values unless the will expressly provides that another value may be used.  If the will requires or permits a different value to be used, all assets available for distribution, including cash, shall unless otherwise expressly provided be so distributed that the assets, including cash, distributed in satisfaction of the bequest will be fairly representative of the net appreciation or depreciation in the value of the available property on the dates of distribution.  A provision in a will that the personal representative may fix values for the purpose of distribution does not of itself constitute authorization to fix a value other than current fair market value.
863.19 Annotation
The valuation of assets for distribution is the current market value at the time of distribution.  Estate of Naulin, 56 Wis. 2d 100, 201 N.W.2d 599 (1972). Down
