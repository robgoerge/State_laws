778.01
778.01â€ƒ
Action for forfeitures.  Where a forfeiture imposed by statute shall be incurred it may be recovered in a civil action unless the act or omission is punishable by fine and imprisonment or by fine or imprisonment.  The word forfeiture, as used in this chapter, includes any penalty, in money or goods.
778.01 History
History:  1979 c. 32 s. 56; Stats. 1979 s. 778.01.778.01 Cross-reference
Cross-reference:  For forfeitures imposed by city or village ordinance, see s. 66.0114.778.01 Annotation
For a forfeiture action to accrue against a nonresident owner of a building that is in violation of the state building code, the violator should receive notice of the violations.  Notice need not be actual, but must be reasonably calculated to inform the building owner with respect to the violation.  State v. James, 47 Wis. 2d 600, 177 N.W.2d 864 (1970).778.01 Annotation
The definition of forfeiture in this section applies only to ch. 288 [now ch. 778].  State v. Mando Enterprises, Inc. 56 Wis. 2d 801, 203 N.W.2d 64 (1973).778.01 Annotation
This section does not preclude prosecution under a statute punishable only by forfeiture in the same action with criminal charges.  State v. Johnston, 184 Wis. 2d 794, 518 N.W.2d 759 (1994).778.01 Annotation
A judgment for payment of a forfeiture can be docketed, accumulates interest, and may be enforced through collection remedies available in other civil proceedings. OAG 2-95.778.015
778.015â€ƒ
Applicability in circuit court.  This chapter applies to actions in circuit court.  The procedure in ss. 778.14, 778.15 and 778.18 and ch. 800 applies to actions in municipal court.

Action in name of state; complaint; attachment.  Every such forfeiture action shall be in the name of the state of Wisconsin, and it is sufficient to allege in the complaint that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of the forfeiture claimed, according to the provisions of the statute that imposes it, specifying the statute, plus costs, fees, and surcharges imposed under ch. 814.  If the statute imposes a forfeiture for several offenses or delinquencies, the complaint shall specify the particular offense or delinquency for which the action is brought, with a demand for judgment for the amount of the forfeiture, plus costs, fees, and surcharges imposed under ch. 814.  If the defendant is a nonresident of the state, an attachment may issue.

Prosecution decisions based on contributions to certain organizations or agencies and government attorney conduct.  A prosecutor or an attorney representing the state or a political subdivision of the state may not, in exchange for a person's payment of money, other than restitution, to any organization or agency, dismiss or amend a citation or complaint alleging a violation that provides for a forfeiture or elect not to initiate an action or special proceeding based on such a violation.

History:  1999 a. 58, 186; 2007 a. 84.778.027 Annotation
A prosecutor may engage in negotiations relating to a defendant's reimbursement of blood withdrawal expenses, but a prosecutor may not, as a result of a defendant's payment or offer of payment of blood withdrawal expenses, dismiss or amend the charge, citation, or complaint or forego the initiation of a criminal prosecution, action, or special proceeding based on the violation.  OAG 11-09.778.03
778.03â€ƒ
Complaint to recover forfeited goods.  In an action to recover property forfeited by any statute it shall be sufficient to allege in the complaint that the property has been forfeited, specifying the statute, with a demand of judgment for the delivery of the property, or the value of the property and for payment of the costs, fees, and surcharges imposed under ch. 814.

When a city neither disputed its violation of an order nor denied that the state was entitled to a forfeiture to the extent of its violation of the order, it was error for the trial court to utilize this section to justify the imposition of a forfeiture less than the statutory minimum.  State v. City of Monona, 63 Wis. 2d 67, 216 N.W.2d 230 (1974).778.09
