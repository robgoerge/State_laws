Habeas corpus, who to have; definitions. 782.01(1)(1)â€‚Every person restrained of personal liberty may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to obtain relief from such restraint subject to ss. 782.02 and 974.06.

(2)â€‚Any person confined in any hospital or institution as mentally ill or committed for treatment of alcoholism under s. 51.45 (13) may prosecute such writ, and the question of mental illness or need for treatment shall be determined by the court or judge issuing the same.  If such court or judge decides that the person is mentally ill or in need of treatment such decision shall not bar the prosecution of such writ a 2nd time if it is claimed that such person has been restored to reason or is no longer in need of treatment.

782.01 History
History:  1971 c. 57; 1973 c. 198; 1977 c. 187, 449; 1979 c. 32 ss. 59, 92 (11); 1979 c. 176; Stats. 1979 s. 782.01; 2001 a. 61.782.01 Annotation
Habeas corpus is a proper remedy with which to challenge the personal jurisdiction of a trial court over a criminal defendant and to challenge a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence when constitutional issues are involved.  State ex rel. Warrender v. Kenosha County Ct. 67 Wis. 2d 333, 227 N.W.2d 450 (1975).782.01 Annotation
A prevailing plaintiff in a habeas corpus proceeding may not be awarded costs.  State ex rel. Korne v. Wolke, 79 Wis. 2d 22, 255 N.W.2d 446 (1977).782.01 Annotation
A defendant released after making a deposit was not "restrained" under sub. (1).  State ex rel. Kelley v. Posner, 91 Wis. 2d 301, 282 N.W.2d 633 (Ct. App. 1979).782.01 Annotation
Habeas corpus is available to persons released on personal recognizance bonds.  State ex rel. Wohlfahrt v. Bodette, 95 Wis. 2d 130, 289 N.W.2d 366 (Ct. App. 1980).782.01 Annotation
A court had no jurisdiction under s. 974.06, relating to post-conviction procedure, to hear a challenge of the computation of a prisoner's good time.  Habeas corpus is the proper avenue of relief.  State v. Johnson, 101 Wis. 2d 698, 305 N.W.2d 188 (Ct. App. 1981).
782.01 Annotation
The procedure for a writ of habeas corpus is discussed.  State ex rel. LeFebre v. Abrahamson, 103 Wis. 2d 197, 307 N.W.2d 186 (1981).782.01 Annotation
Comity between circuit courts was not a sufficient reason to refuse to issue a writ but, under the facts of the case, the penalty for refusing to issue the writ under s. 782.09 was inappropriate.  J.V. v. Barron, 112 Wis. 2d 256, 332 N.W.2d 796 (1983).782.01 Annotation
Habeas corpus is available to a petitioner to challenge a criminal complaint and to test the sufficiency of evidence for bindover.  State ex rel. McCaffrey v. Shanks, 124 Wis. 2d 216, 369 N.W.2d 743 (Ct. App. 1985).  See also State ex rel. Cornellier v. Black, 144 Wis. 2d 745, 425 N.W.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1988). Down
